They do not know My transcendental nature as the Supreme Lord of all that be.PurportFrom the other explanations of the previous verses in this chapter, it is clear that the Supreme Personality of Godhead, although appearing like a human being, is not a common man. The Personality of Godhead, who conducts the creation, maintenance and annihilation of the complete cosmic manifestation, cannot be a human being. Yet there are many foolish men who consider K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to be merely a powerful man and nothing more. Actually, He is the original Supreme Personality, as is confirmed in the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 (\u012b\u015bvara\u1e25 parama\u1e25 k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u1e25); He is the Supreme Lord.There are many \u012b\u015bvaras, controllers, and one appears greater than another. In the ordinary management of affairs in the material world, we find some official or director, and above him there is a secretary, and above him a minister, and above him a president. Each of them is a controller, but one is controlled by another. In the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 it is said that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the supreme controller; there are many controllers undoubtedly, both in the material and spiritual world, but K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the supreme controller (\u012b\u015bvara\u1e25 parama\u1e25 k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u1e25), and His body is sac-cid-\u0101nanda, nonmaterial.Material bodies cannot perform the wonderful acts described in previous verses. His body is eternal, blissful and full of knowledge. Although He is not a common man, the foolish deride Him and consider Him to be a man. His body is called here m\u0101nu\u1e63\u012bm because He is acting just like a man, a friend of Arjuna\u2019s, a politician involved in the Battle of Kuruk\u1e63etra. In so many ways He is acting just like an ordinary man, but actually His body is sac-cid-\u0101nanda-vigraha \u2013 eternal bliss and knowledge absolute. This is confirmed in the Vedic language also. Sac-cid-\u0101nanda-r\u016bp\u0101ya k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47\u0101ya: \u201cI offer my obeisances unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who is the eternal blissful form of knowledge.\u201d (Gop\u0101la-t\u0101pan\u012b Upani\u1e63ad 1.1) There are other descriptions in the Vedic language also. Tam eka\u1e41 govindam: \u201cYou are Govinda, the pleasure of the senses and the cows.\u201d Sac-cid-\u0101nanda-vigraham: \u201cAnd Your form is transcendental, full of knowledge, bliss and eternality.\u201d (Gop\u0101la-t\u0101pan\u012b Upani\u1e63ad 1.38)Despite the transcendental qualities of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s body, its full bliss and knowledge, there are many so-called scholars and commentators of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 who deride K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as an ordinary man. The scholar may be born an extraordinary man due to his previous good work, but this conception of \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is due to a poor fund of knowledge. Therefore he is called m\u016b\u1e0dha, for only foolish persons consider K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to be an ordinary human being. The foolish consider K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a an ordinary human being because they do not know the confidential activities of the Supreme Lord and His different energies. They do not know that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s body is a symbol of complete knowledge and bliss, that He is the proprietor of everything that be and that He can award liberation to anyone. Because they do not know that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a has so many transcendental qualifications, they deride Him.Nor do they know that the appearance of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in this material world is a manifestation of His internal energy. He is the master of the material energy. As has been explained in several places (mama m\u0101y\u0101 duratyay\u0101), He claims that the material energy, although very powerful, is under His control, and whoever surrenders unto Him can get out of the control of this material energy. If a soul surrendered to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a can get out of the influence of material energy, then how can the Supreme Lord, who conducts the creation, maintenance and annihilation of the whole cosmic nature, have a material body like us? So this conception of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is complete foolishness. Foolish persons, however, cannot conceive that the Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, appearing just like an ordinary man, can be the controller of all the atoms and of the gigantic manifestation of the universal form. The biggest and the minutest are beyond their conception, so they cannot imagine that a form like that of a human being can simultaneously control the infinite and the minute. Actually, although He is controlling the infinite and the finite, He is apart from all this manifestation. It is clearly stated concerning His yogam ai\u015bvaram, His inconceivable transcendental energy, that He can control the infinite and the finite simultaneously and that He can remain aloof from them. Although the foolish cannot imagine how K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who appears just like a human being, can control the infinite and the finite, those who are pure devotees accept this, for they know that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore they completely surrender unto Him and engage in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, devotional service of the Lord.There are many controversies between the impersonalists and the personalists about the Lord\u2019s appearance as a human being. But if we consult Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 and \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, the authoritative texts for understanding the science of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, then we can understand that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He is not an ordinary man, although He appeared on this earth as an ordinary human. In the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, First Canto, First Chapter, when the sages headed by \u015aaunaka inquired about the activities of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, they said:k\u1e5btav\u0101n kila karm\u0101\u1e47isaha r\u0101me\u1e47a ke\u015bava\u1e25ati-marty\u0101ni bhagav\u0101ng\u016b\u1e0dha\u1e25 kapa\u1e6da-m\u0101\u1e47u\u1e63a\u1e25\u201cLord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, along with Balar\u0101ma, played like a human being, and so masked He performed many superhuman acts.\u201d (Bh\u0101g. 1.1.20) The Lord\u2019s appearance as a man bewilders the foolish. No human being could perform the wonderful acts that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a performed while He was present on this earth. When K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a appeared before His father and mother, Vasudeva and Devak\u012b, He appeared with four hands, but after the prayers of the parents He transformed Himself into an ordinary child. As stated in the Bh\u0101gavatam (10.3.46), babh\u016bva pr\u0101k\u1e5bta\u1e25 \u015bi\u015bu\u1e25: He became just like an ordinary child, an ordinary human being. Now, here again it is indicated that the Lord\u2019s appearance as an ordinary human being is one of the features of His transcendental body. In the Eleventh Chapter of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 also it is stated that Arjuna prayed to see K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s form of four hands (tenaiva r\u016bpe\u1e47a catur-bhujena). After revealing this form, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, when petitioned by Arjuna, again assumed His original humanlike form (m\u0101nu\u1e63a\u1e41 r\u016bpam). These different features of the Supreme Lord are certainly not those of an ordinary human being.Some of those who deride K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and who are infected with the M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b philosophy quote the following verse from the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (3.29.21) to prove that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is just an ordinary man. Aha\u1e41 sarve\u1e63u bh\u016bte\u1e63u bh\u016bt\u0101tm\u0101vasthita\u1e25 sad\u0101: \u201cThe Supreme is present in every living entity.\u201d We should better take note of this particular verse from the Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava \u0101c\u0101ryas like J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b and Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura instead of following the interpretation of unauthorized persons who deride K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b, commenting on this verse, says that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, in His plenary expansion as Param\u0101tm\u0101, is situated in the moving and the nonmoving entities as the Supersoul, so any neophyte devotee who simply gives his attention to the arc\u0101-m\u016brti, the form of the Supreme Lord in the temple, and does not respect other living entities is uselessly worshiping the form of the Lord in the temple. There are three kinds of devotees of the Lord, and the neophyte is in the lowest stage. The neophyte devotee gives more attention to the Deity in the temple than to other devotees, so Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura warns that this sort of mentality should be corrected. A devotee should see that because K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is present in everyone\u2019s heart as Param\u0101tm\u0101, every body is the embodiment or the temple of the Supreme Lord; so as one offers respect to the temple of the Lord, he should similarly properly respect each and every body in which the Param\u0101tm\u0101 dwells. Everyone should therefore be given proper respect and should not be neglected.There are also many impersonalists who deride temple worship. They say that since God is everywhere, why should one restrict himself to temple worship? But if God is everywhere, is He not in the temple or in the Deity? Although the personalist and the impersonalist will fight with one another perpetually, a perfect devotee in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness knows that although K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Personality, He is all-pervading, as confirmed in the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101. Although His personal abode is Goloka V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana and He is always staying there, by His different manifestations of energy and by His plenary expansion He is present everywhere in all parts of the material and spiritual creation."}
