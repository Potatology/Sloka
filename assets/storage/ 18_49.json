Since he is part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, the results of his work must be enjoyed by the Supreme Lord. This is actually K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. The person acting in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is really a sanny\u0101s\u012b, one in the renounced order of life. By such a mentality, one is satisfied because he is actually acting for the Supreme. Thus he is not attached to anything material; he becomes accustomed to not taking pleasure in anything beyond the transcendental happiness derived from the service of the Lord. A sanny\u0101s\u012b is supposed to be free from the reactions of his past activities, but a person who is in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness automatically attains this perfection without even accepting the so-called order of renunciation. This state of mind is called yog\u0101r\u016b\u1e0dha, or the perfectional stage of yoga. As confirmed in the Third Chapter, yas tv \u0101tma-ratir eva sy\u0101t: one who is satisfied in himself has no fear of any kind of reaction from his activity."}
