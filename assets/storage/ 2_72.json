If one is thus situated even at the hour of death, one can enter into the kingdom of God.That is the way of the spiritual and godly life, after attaining which a man is not bewildered. If one is thus situated even at the hour of death, one can enter into the kingdom of God.PurportOne can attain K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness or divine life at once, within a second \u2013 or one may not attain such a state of life even after millions of births. It is only a matter of understanding and accepting the fact. Kha\u1e6dv\u0101\u1e45ga Mah\u0101r\u0101ja attained this state of life just a few minutes before his death, by surrendering unto K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Nirv\u0101\u1e47a means ending the process of materialistic life. According to Buddhist philosophy, there is only void after the completion of this material life, but Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 teaches differently. Actual life begins after the completion of this material life. For the gross materialist it is sufficient to know that one has to end this materialistic way of life, but for persons who are spiritually advanced, there is another life after this materialistic life. Before ending this life, if one fortunately becomes K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious, he at once attains the stage of brahma-nirv\u0101\u1e47a. There is no difference between the kingdom of God and the devotional service of the Lord. Since both of them are on the absolute plane, to be engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Lord is to have attained the spiritual kingdom. In the material world there are activities of sense gratification, whereas in the spiritual world there are activities of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Attainment of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness even during this life is immediate attainment of Brahman, and one who is situated in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness has certainly already entered into the kingdom of God.Brahman is just the opposite of matter. Therefore br\u0101hm\u012b sthiti means \u201cnot on the platform of material activities.\u201d Devotional service of the Lord is accepted in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 as the liberated stage (sa gu\u1e47\u0101n samat\u012btyait\u0101n brahma-bh\u016by\u0101ya kalpate). Therefore, br\u0101hm\u012b sthiti is liberation from material bondage.\u015ar\u012bla Bhaktivinoda \u1e6ch\u0101kura has summarized this Second Chapter of the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 as being the contents for the whole text. In the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, the subject matters are karma-yoga, j\u00f1\u0101na-yoga and bhakti-yoga. In the Second Chapter karma-yoga and j\u00f1\u0101na-yoga have been clearly discussed, and a glimpse of bhakti-yoga has also been given, as the contents for the complete text.Thus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Second Chapter of the \u015ar\u012bmad Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 in the matter of its Contents."}
