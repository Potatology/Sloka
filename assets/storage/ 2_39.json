Now listen as I explain it in terms of working without fruitive results. O son of P\u1e5bth\u0101, when you act in such knowledge you can free yourself from the bondage of works.Thus far I have described this knowledge to you through analytical study. Now listen as I explain it in terms of working without fruitive results. O son of P\u1e5bth\u0101, when you act in such knowledge you can free yourself from the bondage of works.PurportAccording to the Nirukti, or the Vedic dictionary, sa\u1e45khy\u0101 means that which describes things in detail, and s\u0101\u1e45khya refers to that philosophy which describes the real nature of the soul. And yoga involves controlling the senses. Arjuna\u2019s proposal not to fight was based on sense gratification. Forgetting his prime duty, he wanted to cease fighting, because he thought that by not killing his relatives and kinsmen he would be happier than by enjoying the kingdom after conquering his cousins and brothers, the sons of Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra. In both ways, the basic principles were for sense gratification. Happiness derived from conquering them and happiness derived by seeing kinsmen alive are both on the basis of personal sense gratification, even at a sacrifice of wisdom and duty. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, therefore, wanted to explain to Arjuna that by killing the body of his grandfather he would not be killing the soul proper, and He explained that all individual persons, including the Lord Himself, are eternal individuals; they were individuals in the past, they are individuals in the present, and they will continue to remain individuals in the future, because all of us are individual souls eternally. We simply change our bodily dress in different manners, but actually we keep our individuality even after liberation from the bondage of material dress. An analytical study of the soul and the body has been very graphically explained by Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. And this descriptive knowledge of the soul and the body from different angles of vision has been described here as S\u0101\u1e45khya, in terms of the Nirukti dictionary. This S\u0101\u1e45khya has nothing to do with the S\u0101\u1e45khya philosophy of the atheist Kapila. Long before the imposter Kapila\u2019s S\u0101\u1e45khya, the S\u0101\u1e45khya philosophy was expounded in the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam by the true Lord Kapila, the incarnation of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who explained it to His mother, Devah\u016bti. It is clearly explained by Him that the puru\u1e63a, or the Supreme Lord, is active and that He creates by looking over the prak\u1e5bti. This is accepted in the Vedas and in the G\u012bt\u0101. The description in the Vedas indicates that the Lord glanced over the prak\u1e5bti, or nature, and impregnated it with atomic individual souls. All these individuals are working in the material world for sense gratification, and under the spell of material energy they are thinking of being enjoyers. This mentality is dragged to the last point of liberation when the living entity wants to become one with the Lord. This is the last snare of m\u0101y\u0101, or sense gratificatory illusion, and it is only after many, many births of such sense gratificatory activities that a great soul surrenders unto V\u0101sudeva, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, thereby fulfilling the search after the ultimate truth.Arjuna has already accepted K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as his spiritual master by surrendering himself unto Him: \u015bi\u1e63yas te \u2019ha\u1e41 \u015b\u0101dhi m\u0101\u1e41 tv\u0101\u1e41 prapannam. Consequently, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a will now tell him about the working process in buddhi-yoga, or karma-yoga, or in other words, the practice of devotional service only for the sense gratification of the Lord. This buddhi-yoga is clearly explained in Chapter Ten, verse ten, as being direct communion with the Lord, who is sitting as Param\u0101tm\u0101 in everyone\u2019s heart. But such communion does not take place without devotional service. One who is therefore situated in devotional or transcendental loving service to the Lord, or, in other words, in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, attains to this stage of buddhi-yoga by the special grace of the Lord. The Lord says, therefore, that only to those who are always engaged in devotional service out of transcendental love does He award the pure knowledge of devotion in love. In that way the devotee can reach Him easily in the ever-blissful kingdom of God.Thus the buddhi-yoga mentioned in this verse is the devotional service of the Lord, and the word S\u0101\u1e45khya mentioned herein has nothing to do with the atheistic s\u0101\u1e45khya-yoga enunciated by the imposter Kapila. One should not, therefore, misunderstand that the s\u0101\u1e45khya-yoga mentioned herein has any connection with the atheistic S\u0101\u1e45khya. Nor did that philosophy have any influence during that time; nor would Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a care to mention such godless philosophical speculations. Real S\u0101\u1e45khya philosophy is described by Lord Kapila in the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, but even that S\u0101\u1e45khya has nothing to do with the current topics. Here, S\u0101\u1e45khya means analytical description of the body and the soul. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a made an analytical description of the soul just to bring Arjuna to the point of buddhi-yoga, or bhakti-yoga. Therefore, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s S\u0101\u1e45khya and Lord Kapila\u2019s S\u0101\u1e45khya, as described in the Bh\u0101gavatam, are one and the same. They are all bhakti-yoga. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a said, therefore, that only the less intelligent class of men make a distinction between s\u0101\u1e45khya-yoga and bhakti-yoga (s\u0101\u1e45khya-yogau p\u1e5bthag b\u0101l\u0101\u1e25 pravadanti na pa\u1e47\u1e0dit\u0101\u1e25).Of course, atheistic s\u0101\u1e45khya-yoga has nothing to do with bhakti-yoga, yet the unintelligent claim that the atheistic s\u0101\u1e45khya-yoga is referred to in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101.One should therefore understand that buddhi-yoga means to work in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, in the full bliss and knowledge of devotional service. One who works for the satisfaction of the Lord only, however difficult such work may be, is working under the principles of buddhi-yoga and finds himself always in transcendental bliss. By such transcendental engagement, one achieves all transcendental understanding automatically, by the grace of the Lord, and thus his liberation is complete in itself, without his making extraneous endeavors to acquire knowledge. There is much difference between work in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and work for fruitive results, especially in the matter of sense gratification for achieving results in terms of family or material happiness. Buddhi-yoga is therefore the transcendental quality of the work that we perform."}
