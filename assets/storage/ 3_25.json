A K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person does not do anything which is not conducive to development of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. He may even act exactly like the ignorant person, who is too much attached to material activities, but one is engaged in such activities for the satisfaction of his sense gratification, whereas the other is engaged for the satisfaction of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Therefore, the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person is required to show the people how to act and how to engage the results of action for the purpose of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness."}
