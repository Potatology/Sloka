The cause of the distress of a living entity is forgetfulness of his relationship with God. And the cause of happiness is knowing K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to be the supreme enjoyer of all the activities of the human being, the proprietor of all lands and planets, and the sincerest friend of all living entities. The perfect yog\u012b knows that the living being who is conditioned by the modes of material nature is subjected to the threefold material miseries due to forgetfulness of his relationship with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. And because one in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is happy, he tries to distribute the knowledge of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a everywhere. Since the perfect yog\u012b tries to broadcast the importance of becoming K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious, he is the best philanthropist in the world, and he is the dearest servitor of the Lord. Na ca tasm\u0101n manu\u1e63ye\u1e63u ka\u015bcin me priya-k\u1e5bttama\u1e25 (Bg. 18.69). In other words, a devotee of the Lord always looks to the welfare of all living entities, and in this way he is factually the friend of everyone. He is the best yog\u012b because he does not desire perfection in yoga for his personal benefit, but tries for others also. He does not envy his fellow living entities. Here is a contrast between a pure devotee of the Lord and a yog\u012b interested only in his personal elevation. The yog\u012b who has withdrawn to a secluded place in order to meditate perfectly may not be as perfect as a devotee who is trying his best to turn every man toward K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness."}
