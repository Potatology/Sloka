He should be free from desires and feelings of possessiveness.A transcendentalist should always engage his body, mind and self in relationship with the Supreme; he should live alone in a secluded place and should always carefully control his mind. He should be free from desires and feelings of possessiveness.PurportK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is realized in different degrees as Brahman, Param\u0101tm\u0101 and the Supreme Personality of Godhead. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness means, concisely, to be always engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Lord. But those who are attached to the impersonal Brahman or the localized Supersoul are also partially K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious, because the impersonal Brahman is the spiritual ray of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and the Supersoul is the all-pervading partial expansion of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Thus the impersonalist and the meditator are also indirectly K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious. A directly K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person is the topmost transcendentalist because such a devotee knows what is meant by Brahman and Param\u0101tm\u0101. His knowledge of the Absolute Truth is perfect, whereas the impersonalist and the meditative yog\u012b are imperfectly K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious.Nevertheless, all of these are instructed herewith to be constantly engaged in their particular pursuits so that they may come to the highest perfection sooner or later. The first business of a transcendentalist is to keep the mind always on K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. One should always think of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and not forget Him even for a moment. Concentration of the mind on the Supreme is called sam\u0101dhi, or trance. In order to concentrate the mind, one should always remain in seclusion and avoid disturbance by external objects. He should be very careful to accept favorable and reject unfavorable conditions that affect his realization. And, in perfect determination, he should not hanker after unnecessary material things that entangle him by feelings of possessiveness.All these perfections and precautions are perfectly executed when one is directly in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, because direct K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness means self-abnegation, wherein there is very little chance for material possessiveness. \u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b characterizes K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness in this way:an\u0101saktasya vi\u1e63ay\u0101n, yath\u0101rham upayu\u00f1jata\u1e25nirbandha\u1e25 k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-sambandhe, yukta\u1e41 vair\u0101gyam ucyatepr\u0101pa\u00f1cikatay\u0101 buddhy\u0101hari-sambandhi-vastuna\u1e25mumuk\u1e63ubhi\u1e25 parity\u0101govair\u0101gya\u1e41 phalgu kathyate\u201cWhen one is not attached to anything, but at the same time accepts everything in relation to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, one is rightly situated above possessiveness. On the other hand, one who rejects everything without knowledge of its relationship to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is not as complete in his renunciation.\u201d (Bhakti-ras\u0101m\u1e5bta-sindhu 1.2.255\u2013256)A K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person well knows that everything belongs to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and thus he is always free from feelings of personal possession. As such, he has no hankering for anything on his own personal account. He knows how to accept things in favor of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and how to reject things unfavorable to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. He is always aloof from material things because he is always transcendental, and he is always alone, having nothing to do with persons not in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Therefore a person in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is the perfect yog\u012b."}
