Everything emanates from Me. The wise who perfectly know this engage in My devotional service and worship Me with all their hearts.PurportA learned scholar who has studied the Vedas perfectly and has information from authorities like Lord Caitanya and who knows how to apply these teachings can understand that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the origin of everything in both the material and spiritual worlds, and because he knows this perfectly he becomes firmly fixed in the devotional service of the Supreme Lord. He can never be deviated by any amount of nonsensical commentaries or by fools. All Vedic literature agrees that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the source of Brahm\u0101, \u015aiva and all other demigods. In the Atharva Veda (Gop\u0101la-t\u0101pan\u012b Upani\u1e63ad 1.24) it is said, yo brahm\u0101\u1e47a\u1e41 vidadh\u0101ti p\u016brva\u1e41 yo vai ved\u0101\u1e41\u015b ca g\u0101payati sma k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u1e25: \u201cIt was K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a who in the beginning instructed Brahm\u0101 in Vedic knowledge and who disseminated Vedic knowledge in the past.\u201d Then again the N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a Upani\u1e63ad (1) says, atha puru\u1e63o ha vai n\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47o \u2019k\u0101mayata praj\u0101\u1e25 s\u1e5bjeyeti: \u201cThen the Supreme Personality N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a desired to create living entities.\u201d The Upani\u1e63ad continues, n\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47\u0101d brahm\u0101 j\u0101yate, n\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47\u0101d praj\u0101pati\u1e25 praj\u0101yate, n\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47\u0101d indro j\u0101yate, n\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47\u0101d a\u1e63\u1e6dau vasavo j\u0101yante, n\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47\u0101d ek\u0101da\u015ba rudr\u0101 j\u0101yante, n\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47\u0101d dv\u0101da\u015b\u0101dity\u0101\u1e25: \u201cFrom N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, Brahm\u0101 is born, and from N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a the patriarchs are also born. From N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, Indra is born, from N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a the eight Vasus are born, from N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a the eleven Rudras are born, from N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a the twelve \u0100dityas are born.\u201d This N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a is an expansion of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.It is said in the same Vedas, brahma\u1e47yo devak\u012b-putra\u1e25: \u201cThe son of Devak\u012b, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, is the Supreme Personality.\u201d (N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a Upani\u1e63ad 4) Then it is said, eko vai n\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a \u0101s\u012bn na brahm\u0101 ne\u015b\u0101no n\u0101po n\u0101gni-somau neme dy\u0101v-\u0101p\u1e5bthiv\u012b na nak\u1e63atr\u0101\u1e47i na s\u016brya\u1e25: \u201cIn the beginning of the creation there was only the Supreme Personality N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a. There was no Brahm\u0101, no \u015aiva, no water, no fire, no moon, no heaven and earth, no stars in the sky, no sun.\u201d (Mah\u0101 Upani\u1e63ad 1.2) In the Mah\u0101 Upani\u1e63ad it is also said that Lord \u015aiva was born from the forehead of the Supreme Lord. Thus the Vedas say that it is the Supreme Lord, the creator of Brahm\u0101 and \u015aiva, who is to be worshiped.In the Mok\u1e63a-dharma section of the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a also says,praj\u0101pati\u1e41 ca rudra\u1e41 c\u0101pyaham eva s\u1e5bj\u0101mi vaitau hi m\u0101\u1e41 na vij\u0101n\u012btomama m\u0101y\u0101-vimohitau\u201cThe patriarchs, \u015aiva and others are created by Me, though they do not know that they are created by Me because they are deluded by My illusory energy.\u201d In the Var\u0101ha Pur\u0101\u1e47a it is also said,n\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a\u1e25 paro devastasm\u0101j j\u0101ta\u015b caturmukha\u1e25tasm\u0101d rudro \u2019bhavad deva\u1e25sa ca sarva-j\u00f1at\u0101\u1e41 gata\u1e25\u201cN\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and from Him Brahm\u0101 was born, from whom \u015aiva was born.\u201dLord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the source of all generations, and He is called the most efficient cause of everything. He says, \u201cBecause everything is born of Me, I am the original source of all. Everything is under Me; no one is above Me.\u201d There is no supreme controller other than K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. One who understands K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in such a way from a bona fide spiritual master, with references from Vedic literature, engages all his energy in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and becomes a truly learned man. In comparison to him, all others, who do not know K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a properly, are but fools. Only a fool would consider K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to be an ordinary man. A K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person should not be bewildered by fools; he should avoid all unauthorized commentaries and interpretations on Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 and proceed in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness with determination and firmness."}
