Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in His personal form is here speaking before Arjuna, and still, due to ignorance, impersonalists argue that the Supreme Lord ultimately has no form. Y\u0101mun\u0101c\u0101rya, a great devotee of the Lord in the disciplic succession of R\u0101m\u0101nuj\u0101c\u0101rya, has written a very appropriate verse in this connection. He says,tv\u0101\u1e41 \u015b\u012bla-r\u016bpa-caritai\u1e25 parama-prak\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6dai\u1e25sattvena s\u0101ttvikatay\u0101 prabalai\u015b ca \u015b\u0101strai\u1e25prakhy\u0101ta-daiva-param\u0101rtha-vid\u0101\u1e41 matai\u015b canaiv\u0101sura-prak\u1e5btaya\u1e25 prabhavanti boddhum\u201cMy dear Lord, devotees like Vy\u0101sadeva and N\u0101rada know You to be the Personality of Godhead. By understanding different Vedic literatures, one can come to know Your characteristics, Your form and Your activities, and one can thus understand that You are the Supreme Personality of Godhead. But those who are in the modes of passion and ignorance, the demons, the nondevotees, cannot understand You. They are unable to understand You. However expert such nondevotees may be in discussing Ved\u0101nta and the Upani\u1e63ads and other Vedic literatures, it is not possible for them to understand the Personality of Godhead.\u201d (Stotra-ratna 12)In the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 it is stated that the Personality of Godhead cannot be understood simply by study of the Ved\u0101nta literature. Only by the mercy of the Supreme Lord can the Personality of the Supreme be known. Therefore in this verse it is clearly stated that not only are the worshipers of the demigods less intelligent, but those nondevotees who are engaged in Ved\u0101nta and speculation on Vedic literature without any tinge of true K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness are also less intelligent, and for them it is not possible to understand God\u2019s personal nature. Persons who are under the impression that the Absolute Truth is impersonal are described as abuddhaya\u1e25, which means those who do not know the ultimate feature of the Absolute Truth. In the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam it is stated that supreme realization begins from the impersonal Brahman and then rises to the localized Supersoul \u2013 but the ultimate word in the Absolute Truth is the Personality of Godhead. Modern impersonalists are still less intelligent, for they do not even follow their great predecessor \u015aa\u1e45kar\u0101c\u0101rya, who has specifically stated that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Impersonalists, therefore, not knowing the Supreme Truth, think K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to be only the son of Devak\u012b and Vasudeva, or a prince, or a powerful living entity. This is also condemned in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (9.11). Avaj\u0101nanti m\u0101\u1e41 m\u016b\u1e0dh\u0101 m\u0101nu\u1e63\u012b\u1e41 tanum \u0101\u015britam: \u201cOnly the fools regard Me as an ordinary person.\u201dThe fact is that no one can understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a without rendering devotional service and without developing K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. The Bh\u0101gavatam (10.14.29) confirms this:ath\u0101pi te deva pad\u0101mbuja-dvaya-pras\u0101da-le\u015b\u0101nug\u1e5bh\u012bta eva hij\u0101n\u0101ti tattva\u1e41 bhagavan-mahimnona c\u0101nya eko \u2019pi cira\u1e41 vicinvan\u201cMy Lord, if one is favored by even a slight trace of the mercy of Your lotus feet, he can understand the greatness of Your personality. But those who speculate to understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead are unable to know You, even though they continue to study the Vedas for many years.\u201d One cannot understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, or His form, quality or name simply by mental speculation or by discussing Vedic literature. One must understand Him by devotional service. When one is fully engaged in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, beginning by chanting the mah\u0101-mantra \u2013 Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare \u2013 then only can one understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Nondevotee impersonalists think that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a has a body made of this material nature and that all His activities, His form and everything are m\u0101y\u0101. These impersonalists are known as M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012bs. They do not know the ultimate truth.The twentieth verse clearly states, k\u0101mais tais tair h\u1e5bta-j\u00f1\u0101n\u0101\u1e25 prapadyante \u2019nya-devat\u0101\u1e25: \u201cThose who are blinded by lusty desires surrender unto the different demigods.\u201d It is accepted that besides the Supreme Personality of Godhead, there are demigods who have their different planets, and the Lord also has a planet. As stated in the twenty-third verse, dev\u0101n deva-yajo y\u0101nti mad-bhakt\u0101 y\u0101nti m\u0101m api: the worshipers of the demigods go to the different planets of the demigods, and those who are devotees of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a go to the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47aloka planet. Although this is clearly stated, the foolish impersonalists still maintain that the Lord is formless and that these forms are impositions. From the study of the G\u012bt\u0101 does it appear that the demigods and their abodes are impersonal? Clearly, neither the demigods nor K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, are impersonal. They are all persons; Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and He has His own planet, and the demigods have theirs.Therefore the monistic contention that ultimate truth is formless and that form is imposed does not hold true. It is clearly stated here that it is not imposed. From the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 we can clearly understand that the forms of the demigods and the form of the Supreme Lord are simultaneously existing and that Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is sac-cid-\u0101nanda, eternal blissful knowledge. The Vedic literature confirms that the Supreme Absolute Truth is knowledge and blissful pleasure, vij\u00f1\u0101nam \u0101nandam brahma (B\u1e5bhad-\u0101ra\u1e47yaka Upani\u1e63ad 3.9.28), and that He is the reservoir of unlimited auspicious qualities, ananta-kaly\u0101na-gu\u1e47\u0101tmako \u2019sau (Vi\u1e63\u1e47u Pur\u0101\u1e47a 6.5.84). And in the G\u012bt\u0101 the Lord says that although He is aja (unborn), He still appears. These are the facts that we should understand from the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. We cannot understand how the Supreme Personality of Godhead can be impersonal; the imposition theory of the impersonalist monist is false as far as the statements of the G\u012bt\u0101 are concerned. It is clear herein that the Supreme Absolute Truth, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, has both form and personality."}
