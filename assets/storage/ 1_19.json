Such occurrences are not mentioned, but in this particular verse it is mentioned that the hearts of the sons of Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra were shattered by the sounds vibrated by the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas\u2019 party. This is due to the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas and their confidence in Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. One who takes shelter of the Supreme Lord has nothing to fear, even in the midst of the greatest calamity."}
