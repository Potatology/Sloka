The sons of Aditi are called \u0100dityas, and the sons of Diti are called Daityas. All the \u0100dityas are devotees of the Lord, and all the Daityas are atheistic. Although Prahl\u0101da was born in the family of the Daityas, he was a great devotee from his childhood. Because of his devotional service and godly nature, he is considered to be a representative of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.There are many subduing principles, but time wears down all things in the material universe and so represents K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Of the many animals, the lion is the most powerful and ferocious, and of the million varieties of birds, Garu\u1e0da, the bearer of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, is the greatest."}
