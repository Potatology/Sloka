Therefore please bestow Your grace upon me and reveal again Your form as the Personality of Godhead, O Lord of lords, O abode of the universe.PurportArjuna is always in confidence with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a because he is a very dear friend, and as a dear friend is gladdened by his friend\u2019s opulence, Arjuna is very joyful to see that his friend K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead and can show such a wonderful universal form. But at the same time, after seeing that universal form, he is afraid that he has committed so many offenses to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a out of his unalloyed friendship. Thus his mind is disturbed out of fear, although he had no reason to fear. Arjuna therefore is asking K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to show His N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a form, because He can assume any form. This universal form is material and temporary, as the material world is temporary. But in the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha planets He has His transcendental form with four hands as N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a. There are innumerable planets in the spiritual sky, and in each of them K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is present by His plenary manifestations of different names. Thus Arjuna desired to see one of the forms manifest in the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha planets. Of course in each Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha planet the form of N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a is four-handed, but the four hands hold different arrangements of symbols \u2013 the conchshell, mace, lotus and disc. According to the different hands these four things are held in, the N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47as are variously named. All of these forms are one with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a; therefore Arjuna requests to see His four-handed feature."}
