They leave everything in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s hands and so easily and happily return to Godhead. But those who are not unalloyed devotees and who depend instead on such methods of spiritual realization as karma-yoga, j\u00f1\u0101na-yoga and ha\u1e6dha-yoga must leave the body at a suitable time in order to be sure of whether or not they will return to the world of birth and death.If the yog\u012b is perfect he can select the time and situation for leaving this material world. But if he is not so expert his success depends on his accidentally passing away at a certain suitable time. The suitable times at which one passes away and does not come back are explained by the Lord in the next verse. According to \u0100c\u0101rya Baladeva Vidy\u0101bh\u016b\u1e63a\u1e47a, the Sanskrit word k\u0101la used herein refers to the presiding deity of time."}
