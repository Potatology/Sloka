This was all presented unsystematically. A more organized outline of the path would be necessary for action and understanding. Arjuna, therefore, wanted to clear up these apparently confusing matters so that any common man could accept them without misinterpretation. Although K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a had no intention of confusing Arjuna by any jugglery of words, Arjuna could not follow the process of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness \u2013 either by inertia or by active service. In other words, by his questions he is clearing the path of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness for all students who seriously want to understand the mystery of the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101."}
