The supply of air, light, water and all other benedictions for maintaining the body and soul of every living entity is entrusted to the demigods, who are innumerable assistants in different parts of the body of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Their pleasures and displeasures are dependent on the performance of yaj\u00f1as by the human being. Some of the yaj\u00f1as are meant to satisfy particular demigods; but even in so doing, Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is worshiped in all yaj\u00f1as as the chief beneficiary. It is stated also in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself is the beneficiary of all kinds of yaj\u00f1as: bhokt\u0101ra\u1e41 yaj\u00f1a-tapas\u0101m. Therefore, ultimate satisfaction of the yaj\u00f1a-pati is the chief purpose of all yaj\u00f1as. When these yaj\u00f1as are perfectly performed, naturally the demigods in charge of the different departments of supply are pleased, and there is no scarcity in the supply of natural products.Performance of yaj\u00f1as has many side benefits, ultimately leading to liberation from material bondage. By performance of yaj\u00f1as, all activities become purified, as it is stated in the Vedas: \u0101h\u0101ra-\u015buddhau sattva-\u015buddhi\u1e25 sattva-\u015buddhau dhruv\u0101 sm\u1e5bti\u1e25 sm\u1e5bti-lambhe sarva-granth\u012bn\u0101\u1e41 vipramok\u1e63a\u1e25. By performance of yaj\u00f1a one\u2019s eatables become sanctified, and by eating sanctified foodstuffs one\u2019s very existence becomes purified; by the purification of existence finer tissues in the memory become sanctified, and when memory is sanctified one can think of the path of liberation, and all these combined together lead to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, the great necessity of present-day society."}
