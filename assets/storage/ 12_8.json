Thus you will live in Me always, without a doubt.PurportOne who is engaged in Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s devotional service lives in a direct relationship with the Supreme Lord, so there is no doubt that his position is transcendental from the very beginning. A devotee does not live on the material plane \u2013 he lives in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The holy name of the Lord and the Lord are nondifferent; therefore when a devotee chants Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and His internal potency are dancing on the tongue of the devotee. When he offers K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a food, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a directly accepts these eatables, and the devotee becomes K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-ized by eating the remnants. One who does not engage in such service cannot understand how this is so, although this is a process recommended in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 and in other Vedic literatures."}
