With your activities dedicated to Me and your mind and intelligence fixed on Me, you will attain Me without doubt.PurportThis instruction to Arjuna is very important for all men engaged in material activities. The Lord does not say that one should give up his prescribed duties or engagements. One can continue them and at the same time think of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a by chanting Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. This will free one from material contamination and engage the mind and intelligence in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. By chanting K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s names, one will be transferred to the supreme planet, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47aloka, without a doubt."}
