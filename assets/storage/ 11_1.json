He is even the cause of the Mah\u0101-vi\u1e63\u1e47u, from whom the material universes emanate. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is not an incarnation; He is the source of all incarnations. That has been completely explained in the last chapter.Now, as far as Arjuna is concerned, he says that his illusion is over. This means that Arjuna no longer thinks of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as a mere human being, as a friend of his, but as the source of everything. Arjuna is very enlightened and is glad that he has such a great friend as K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, but now he is thinking that although he may accept K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as the source of everything, others may not. So in order to establish K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s divinity for all, he is requesting K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in this chapter to show His universal form. Actually when one sees the universal form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a one becomes frightened, like Arjuna, but K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is so kind that after showing it He converts Himself again into His original form. Arjuna agrees to what K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a has several times said: K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is speaking to him just for his benefit. So Arjuna acknowledges that all this is happening to him by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s grace. He is now convinced that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the cause of all causes and is present in everyone\u2019s heart as the Supersoul."}
