It indicates that both Arjuna and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a were sitting on the chariot when Arjuna saw the universal form. Others on the battlefield could not see this form, because K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a gave the vision only to Arjuna. Arjuna could see in the body of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a many thousands of planets. As we learn from Vedic scriptures, there are many universes and many planets. Some of them are made of earth, some are made of gold, some are made of jewels, some are very great, some are not so great, etc. Sitting on his chariot, Arjuna could see all these. But no one could understand what was going on between Arjuna and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a."}
