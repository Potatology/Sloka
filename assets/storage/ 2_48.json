Such equanimity is called yoga.Perform your duty equipoised, O Arjuna, abandoning all attachment to success or failure. Such equanimity is called yoga.PurportK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a tells Arjuna that he should act in yoga. And what is that yoga? Yoga means to concentrate the mind upon the Supreme by controlling the ever-disturbing senses. And who is the Supreme? The Supreme is the Lord. And because He Himself is telling Arjuna to fight, Arjuna has nothing to do with the results of the fight. Gain or victory are K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s concern; Arjuna is simply advised to act according to the dictation of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The following of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s dictation is real yoga, and this is practiced in the process called K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. By K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness only can one give up the sense of proprietorship. One has to become the servant of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, or the servant of the servant of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. That is the right way to discharge duty in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, which alone can help one to act in yoga.Arjuna is a k\u1e63atriya, and as such he is participating in the var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama-dharma institution. It is said in the Vi\u1e63\u1e47u Pur\u0101\u1e47a that in the var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama-dharma, the whole aim is to satisfy Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. No one should satisfy himself, as is the rule in the material world, but one should satisfy K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. So unless one satisfies K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, one cannot correctly observe the principles of var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama-dharma. Indirectly, Arjuna was advised to act as K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a told him."}
