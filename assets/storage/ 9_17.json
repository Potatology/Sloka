I am the object of knowledge, the purifier and the syllable o\u1e41. I am also the \u1e5ag, the S\u0101ma and the Yajur Vedas.I am the father of this universe, the mother, the support and the grandsire. I am the object of knowledge, the purifier and the syllable o\u1e41. I am also the \u1e5ag, the S\u0101ma and the Yajur Vedas.PurportThe entire cosmic manifestations, moving and nonmoving, are manifested by different activities of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s energy. In the material existence we create different relationships with different living entities who are nothing but K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s marginal energy; under the creation of prak\u1e5bti some of them appear as our father, mother, grandfather, creator, etc., but actually they are parts and parcels of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. As such, these living entities who appear to be our father, mother, etc., are nothing but K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. In this verse the word dh\u0101t\u0101 means \u201ccreator.\u201d Not only are our father and mother parts and parcels of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, but the creator, grandmother and grandfather, etc., are also K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Actually any living entity, being part and parcel of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. All the Vedas, therefore, aim only toward K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Whatever we want to know through the Vedas is but a progressive step toward understanding K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. That subject matter which helps us purify our constitutional position is especially K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Similarly, the living entity who is inquisitive to understand all Vedic principles is also part and parcel of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and as such is also K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. In all the Vedic mantras the word o\u1e41, called pra\u1e47ava, is a transcendental sound vibration and is also K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. And because in all the hymns of the four Vedas \u2013 S\u0101ma, Yajur, \u1e5ag and Atharva \u2013 the pra\u1e47ava, or o\u1e41-k\u0101ra, is very prominent, it is understood to be K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a."}
