Brahm\u0101 is the original creature born out of the energy of the Supreme Lord, who is known as Hira\u1e47yagarbha. And from Brahm\u0101 all the seven great sages, and before them four other great sages, named Sanaka, Sananda, San\u0101tana and Sanat-kum\u0101ra, and the fourteen Manus, are manifested. All these twenty-five great sages are known as the patriarchs of the living entities all over the universe. There are innumerable universes and innumerable planets within each universe, and each planet is full of population of different varieties. All of them are born of these twenty-five patriarchs. Brahm\u0101 underwent penance for one thousand years of the demigods before he realized by the grace of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a how to create. Then from Brahm\u0101 came Sanaka, Sananda, San\u0101tana and Sanat-kum\u0101ra, then Rudra, and then the seven sages, and in this way all the br\u0101hma\u1e47as and k\u1e63atriyas are born out of the energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Brahm\u0101 is known as Pit\u0101maha, the grandfather, and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is known as Prapit\u0101maha, the father of the grandfather. That is stated in the Eleventh Chapter of the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (11.39)."}
