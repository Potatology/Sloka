Everything rests upon Me, as pearls are strung on a thread.PurportThere is a common controversy over whether the Supreme Absolute Truth is personal or impersonal. As far as Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is concerned, the Absolute Truth is the Personality of Godhead, \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and this is confirmed in every step. In this verse, in particular, it is stressed that the Absolute Truth is a person. That the Personality of Godhead is the Supreme Absolute Truth is also the affirmation of the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101: \u012b\u015bvara\u1e25 parama\u1e25 k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u1e25 sac-cid-\u0101nanda-vigraha\u1e25; that is, the Supreme Absolute Truth Personality of Godhead is Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who is the primeval Lord, the reservoir of all pleasure, Govinda, and the eternal form of complete bliss and knowledge. These authorities leave no doubt that the Absolute Truth is the Supreme Person, the cause of all causes. The impersonalist, however, argues on the strength of the Vedic version given in the \u015avet\u0101\u015bvatara Upani\u1e63ad (3.10): tato yad uttara-tara\u1e41 tad ar\u016bpam an\u0101mayam/ ya etad vidur am\u1e5bt\u0101s te bhavanti athetare du\u1e25kham ev\u0101piyanti. \u201cIn the material world Brahm\u0101, the primeval living entity within the universe, is understood to be the supreme amongst the demigods, human beings and lower animals. But beyond Brahm\u0101 there is the Transcendence, who has no material form and is free from all material contaminations. Anyone who can know Him also becomes transcendental, but those who do not know Him suffer the miseries of the material world.\u201dThe impersonalist puts more stress on the word ar\u016bpam. But this ar\u016bpam is not impersonal. It indicates the transcendental form of eternity, bliss and knowledge as described in the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 quoted above. Other verses in the \u015avet\u0101\u015bvatara Upani\u1e63ad (3.8\u20139) substantiate this as follows:ved\u0101ham eta\u1e41 puru\u1e63a\u1e41 mah\u0101ntam\u0101ditya-var\u1e47a\u1e41 tamasa\u1e25 parast\u0101ttam eva viditv\u0101ti m\u1e5btyum etin\u0101nya\u1e25 panth\u0101 vidyate \u2019yan\u0101yayasm\u0101t para\u1e41 n\u0101param asti ki\u00f1cidyasm\u0101n n\u0101\u1e47\u012byo no jy\u0101yo \u2019sti ki\u00f1citv\u1e5bk\u1e63a iva stabdho divi ti\u1e63\u1e6dhaty ekasteneda\u1e41 p\u016br\u1e47a\u1e41 puru\u1e63e\u1e47a sarvam\u201cI know that Supreme Personality of Godhead who is transcendental to all material conceptions of darkness. Only he who knows Him can transcend the bonds of birth and death. There is no way for liberation other than this knowledge of that Supreme Person.\u201cThere is no truth superior to that Supreme Person, because He is the supermost. He is smaller than the smallest, and He is greater than the greatest. He is situated as a silent tree, and He illumines the transcendental sky, and as a tree spreads its roots, He spreads His extensive energies.\u201dFrom these verses one concludes that the Supreme Absolute Truth is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is all-pervading by His multi-energies, both material and spiritual."}
