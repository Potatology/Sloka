A perfect yog\u012b is so well disciplined in the activities of the mind that he can no longer be disturbed by any kind of material desire. This perfectional stage can automatically be attained by persons in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, as stated in the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (9.4.18\u201320):sa vai mana\u1e25 k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-pad\u0101ravindayorvac\u0101\u1e41si vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha-gu\u1e47\u0101nuvar\u1e47anekarau harer mandira-m\u0101rjan\u0101di\u1e63u\u015bruti\u1e41 cak\u0101r\u0101cyuta-sat-kathodayemukunda-li\u1e45g\u0101laya-dar\u015bane d\u1e5b\u015bautad-bh\u1e5btya-g\u0101tra-spar\u015be \u2019\u1e45ga-sa\u1e45gamamghr\u0101\u1e47a\u1e41 ca tat-p\u0101da-saroja-saurabhe\u015br\u012bmat-tulasy\u0101 rasan\u0101\u1e41 tad-arpitep\u0101dau hare\u1e25 k\u1e63etra-pad\u0101nusarpa\u1e47e\u015biro h\u1e5b\u1e63\u012bke\u015ba-pad\u0101bhivandanek\u0101ma\u1e41 ca d\u0101sye na tu k\u0101ma-k\u0101myay\u0101yathottama-\u015bloka-jan\u0101\u015bray\u0101 rati\u1e25\u201cKing Ambar\u012b\u1e63a first of all engaged his mind on the lotus feet of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a; then, one after another, he engaged his words in describing the transcendental qualities of the Lord, his hands in mopping the temple of the Lord, his ears in hearing of the activities of the Lord, his eyes in seeing the transcendental forms of the Lord, his body in touching the bodies of the devotees, his sense of smell in smelling the scents of the lotus flowers offered to the Lord, his tongue in tasting the tulas\u012b leaf offered at the lotus feet of the Lord, his legs in going to places of pilgrimage and the temple of the Lord, his head in offering obeisances unto the Lord, and his desires in executing the mission of the Lord. All these transcendental activities are quite befitting a pure devotee.\u201dThis transcendental stage may be inexpressible subjectively by the followers of the impersonalist path, but it becomes very easy and practical for a person in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, as is apparent in the above description of the engagements of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Ambar\u012b\u1e63a. Unless the mind is fixed on the lotus feet of the Lord by constant remembrance, such transcendental engagements are not practical. In the devotional service of the Lord, therefore, these prescribed activities are called arcana, or engaging all the senses in the service of the Lord. The senses and the mind require engagements. Simple abnegation is not practical. Therefore, for people in general \u2013 especially those who are not in the renounced order of life \u2013 transcendental engagement of the senses and the mind as described above is the perfect process for transcendental achievement, which is called yukta in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101."}
