This perfection is characterized by one\u2019s ability to see the Self by the pure mind and to relish and rejoice in the Self. In that joyous state, one is situated in boundless transcendental happiness, realized through transcendental senses. Established thus, one never departs from the truth, and upon gaining this he thinks there is no greater gain. Being situated in such a position, one is never shaken, even in the midst of greatest difficulty. This indeed is actual freedom from all miseries arising from material contact.In the stage of perfection called trance, or sam\u0101dhi, one\u2019s mind is completely restrained from material mental activities by practice of yoga.

Being situated in such a position, one is never shaken, even in the midst of greatest difficulty. This indeed is actual freedom from all miseries arising from material contact.PurportBy practice of yoga one becomes gradually detached from material concepts. This is the primary characteristic of the yoga principle. And after this, one becomes situated in trance, or sam\u0101dhi, which means that the yog\u012b realizes the Supersoul through transcendental mind and intelligence, without any of the misgivings of identifying the self with the Superself. Yoga practice is more or less based on the principles of the Pata\u00f1jali system. Some unauthorized commentators try to identify the individual soul with the Supersoul, and the monists think this to be liberation, but they do not understand the real purpose of the Pata\u00f1jali system of yoga. There is an acceptance of transcendental pleasure in the Pata\u00f1jali system, but the monists do not accept this transcendental pleasure, out of fear of jeopardizing the theory of oneness. The duality of knowledge and knower is not accepted by the nondualist, but in this verse transcendental pleasure \u2013 realized through transcendental senses \u2013 is accepted. And this is corroborated by Pata\u00f1jali Muni, the famous exponent of the yoga system. The great sage declares in his Yoga-s\u016btras (4.33): puru\u1e63\u0101rtha-\u015b\u016bny\u0101n\u0101\u1e41 gu\u1e47\u0101n\u0101\u1e41 pratiprasava\u1e25 kaivalya\u1e41 svar\u016bpa-prati\u1e63\u1e6dh\u0101 v\u0101 citi-\u015baktir iti.This citi-\u015bakti, or internal potency, is transcendental. Puru\u1e63\u0101rtha means material religiosity, economic development, sense gratification and, at the end, the attempt to become one with the Supreme. This \u201coneness with the Supreme\u201d is called kaivalyam by the monist. But according to Pata\u00f1jali, this kaivalyam is an internal, or transcendental, potency by which the living entity becomes aware of his constitutional position. In the words of Lord Caitanya, this state of affairs is called ceto-darpa\u1e47a-m\u0101rjanam, or clearance of the impure mirror of the mind. This \u201cclearance\u201d is actually liberation, or bhava-mah\u0101-d\u0101v\u0101gni-nirv\u0101pa\u1e47am. The theory of nirv\u0101\u1e47a \u2013 also preliminary \u2013 corresponds with this principle. In the Bh\u0101gavatam (2.10.6) this is called svar\u016bpe\u1e47a vyavasthiti\u1e25. The Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 also confirms this situation in this verse.After nirv\u0101\u1e47a, or material cessation, there is the manifestation of spiritual activities, or devotional service to the Lord, known as K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. In the words of the Bh\u0101gavatam, svar\u016bpe\u1e47a vyavasthiti\u1e25: this is the \u201creal life of the living entity.\u201d M\u0101y\u0101, or illusion, is the condition of spiritual life contaminated by material infection. Liberation from this material infection does not mean destruction of the original eternal position of the living entity. Pata\u00f1jali also accepts this by his words kaivalya\u1e41 svar\u016bpa-prati\u1e63\u1e6dh\u0101 v\u0101 citi-\u015baktir iti. This citi-\u015bakti, or transcendental pleasure, is real life. This is confirmed in the Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra (1.1.12) as \u0101nanda-mayo \u2019bhy\u0101s\u0101t. This natural transcendental pleasure is the ultimate goal of yoga and is easily achieved by execution of devotional service, or bhakti-yoga. Bhakti-yoga will be vividly described in the Seventh Chapter of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101.In the yoga system, as described in this chapter, there are two kinds of sam\u0101dhi, called sampraj\u00f1\u0101ta-sam\u0101dhi and asampraj\u00f1\u0101ta-sam\u0101dhi. When one becomes situated in the transcendental position by various philosophical researches, he is said to have achieved sampraj\u00f1\u0101ta-sam\u0101dhi. In the asampraj\u00f1\u0101ta-sam\u0101dhi there is no longer any connection with mundane pleasure, for one is then transcendental to all sorts of happiness derived from the senses. When the yog\u012b is once situated in that transcendental position, he is never shaken from it. Unless the yog\u012b is able to reach this position, he is unsuccessful. Today\u2019s so-called yoga practice, which involves various sense pleasures, is contradictory. A yog\u012b indulging in sex and intoxication is a mockery. Even those yog\u012bs who are attracted by the siddhis (perfections) in the process of yoga are not perfectly situated. If yog\u012bs are attracted by the by-products of yoga, then they cannot attain the stage of perfection, as is stated in this verse. Persons, therefore, indulging in the make-show practice of gymnastic feats or siddhis should know that the aim of yoga is lost in that way.The best practice of yoga in this age is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, which is not baffling. A K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person is so happy in his occupation that he does not aspire after any other happiness. There are many impediments, especially in this age of hypocrisy, to practicing ha\u1e6dha-yoga, dhy\u0101na-yoga and j\u00f1\u0101na-yoga, but there is no such problem in executing karma-yoga or bhakti-yoga.As long as the material body exists, one has to meet the demands of the body, namely eating, sleeping, defending and mating. But a person who is in pure bhakti-yoga, or in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, does not arouse the senses while meeting the demands of the body. Rather, he accepts the bare necessities of life, making the best use of a bad bargain, and enjoys transcendental happiness in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. He is callous toward incidental occurrences \u2013 such as accidents, disease, scarcity and even the death of a most dear relative \u2013 but he is always alert to execute his duties in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, or bhakti-yoga. Accidents never deviate him from his duty. As stated in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (2.14), \u0101gam\u0101p\u0101yino \u2019nity\u0101s t\u0101\u1e41s titik\u1e63asva bh\u0101rata. He endures all such incidental occurrences because he knows that they come and go and do not affect his duties. In this way he achieves the highest perfection in yoga practice."}
