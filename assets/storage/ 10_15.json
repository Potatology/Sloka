Persons of demonic or atheistic mentality cannot know K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Mental speculation that leads one away from the Supreme Lord is a serious sin, and one who does not know K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a should not try to comment on Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is the statement of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and since it is the science of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, it should be understood from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as Arjuna understood it. It should not be received from atheistic persons.As stated in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (1.2.11):vadanti tat tattva-vidastattva\u1e41 yaj j\u00f1\u0101nam advayambrahmeti param\u0101tmetibhagav\u0101n iti \u015babdyateThe Supreme Truth is realized in three aspects: as impersonal Brahman, localized Param\u0101tm\u0101 and at last as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. So at the last stage of understanding the Absolute Truth, one comes to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. A common man or even a liberated man who has realized impersonal Brahman or localized Param\u0101tm\u0101 may not understand God\u2019s personality. Such men, therefore, may endeavor to understand the Supreme Person from the verses of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, which are being spoken by this person, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Sometimes the impersonalists accept K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as Bhagav\u0101n, or they accept His authority. Yet many liberated persons cannot understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as Puru\u1e63ottama, the Supreme Person. Therefore Arjuna addresses Him as Puru\u1e63ottama. Yet one still may not understand that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the father of all living entities. Therefore Arjuna addresses Him as Bh\u016bta-bh\u0101vana. And if one comes to know Him as the father of all the living entities, still one may not know Him as the supreme controller; therefore He is addressed here as Bh\u016bte\u015ba, the supreme controller of everyone. And even if one knows K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as the supreme controller of all living entities, still one may not know that He is the origin of all the demigods; therefore He is addressed herein as Deva-deva, the worshipful God of all demigods. And even if one knows Him as the worshipful God of all demigods, one may not know that He is the supreme proprietor of everything; therefore He is addressed as Jagat-pati. Thus the truth about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is established in this verse by the realization of Arjuna, and we should follow in the footsteps of Arjuna to understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as He is."}
