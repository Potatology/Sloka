Therefore, just for the sake of educating the people in general, you should perform your work.PurportKings like Janaka were all self-realized souls; consequently they had no obligation to perform the prescribed duties in the Vedas. Nonetheless they performed all prescribed activities just to set examples for the people in general. Janaka was the father of S\u012bt\u0101 and father-in-law of Lord \u015ar\u012b R\u0101ma. Being a great devotee of the Lord, he was transcendentally situated, but because he was the king of Mithil\u0101 (a subdivision of Bihar province in India), he had to teach his subjects how to perform prescribed duties. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and Arjuna, the Lord\u2019s eternal friend, had no need to fight in the Battle of Kuruk\u1e63etra, but they fought to teach people in general that violence is also necessary in a situation where good arguments fail. Before the Battle of Kuruk\u1e63etra, every effort was made to avoid the war, even by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but the other party was determined to fight. So for such a right cause, there is a necessity for fighting. Although one who is situated in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness may not have any interest in the world, he still works to teach the public how to live and how to act. Experienced persons in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness can act in such a way that others will follow, and this is explained in the following verse."}
