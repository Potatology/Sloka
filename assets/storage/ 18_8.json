Such action never leads to the elevation of renunciation.PurportOne who is in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness should not give up earning money out of fear that he is performing fruitive activities. If by working one can engage his money in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, or if by rising early in the morning one can advance his transcendental K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, one should not desist out of fear or because such activities are considered troublesome. Such renunciation is in the mode of passion. The result of passionate work is always miserable. If a person renounces work in that spirit, he never gets the result of renunciation."}
