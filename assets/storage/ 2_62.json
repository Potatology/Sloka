The senses require real engagements, and if they are not engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Lord, they will certainly seek engagement in the service of materialism. In the material world everyone, including Lord \u015aiva and Lord Brahm\u0101 \u2013 to say nothing of other demigods in the heavenly planets \u2013 is subjected to the influence of sense objects, and the only method to get out of this puzzle of material existence is to become K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious. Lord \u015aiva was deep in meditation, but when P\u0101rvat\u012b agitated him for sense pleasure, he agreed to the proposal, and as a result K\u0101rtikeya was born. When Harid\u0101sa \u1e6ch\u0101kura was a young devotee of the Lord, he was similarly allured by the incarnation of M\u0101y\u0101-dev\u012b, but Harid\u0101sa easily passed the test because of his unalloyed devotion to Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. As illustrated in the above-mentioned verse of \u015ar\u012b Y\u0101mun\u0101c\u0101rya, a sincere devotee of the Lord shuns all material sense enjoyment due to his higher taste for spiritual enjoyment in the association of the Lord. That is the secret of success. One who is not, therefore, in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, however powerful he may be in controlling the senses by artificial repression, is sure ultimately to fail, for the slightest thought of sense pleasure will agitate him to gratify his desires."}
