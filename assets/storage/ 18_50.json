One attains the supreme stage of Brahman simply by renouncing the result of his work for the satisfaction of the Supreme Lord. That is the process of self-realization. The actual perfection of knowledge is in attaining pure K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness; that is described in the following verses."}
