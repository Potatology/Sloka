With a single fragment of Myself I pervade and support this entire universe.PurportThe Supreme Lord is represented throughout the entire material universes by His entering into all things as the Supersoul. The Lord here tells Arjuna that there is no point in understanding how things exist in their separate opulence and grandeur. He should know that all things are existing due to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s entering them as Supersoul. From Brahm\u0101, the most gigantic entity, on down to the smallest ant, all are existing because the Lord has entered each and all and is sustaining them.There is a Mission that regularly propounds that worship of any demigod will lead one to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, or the supreme goal. But worship of demigods is thoroughly discouraged herein because even the greatest demigods like Brahm\u0101 and \u015aiva represent only part of the opulence of the Supreme Lord. He is the origin of everyone born, and no one is greater than Him. He is asamaurdhva, which means that no one is superior to Him and that no one is equal to Him. In the Padma Pur\u0101\u1e47a it is said that one who considers the Supreme Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in the same category with demigods \u2013 be they even Brahm\u0101 or \u015aiva \u2013 becomes at once an atheist. If, however, one thoroughly studies the different descriptions of the opulences and expansions of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s energy, then one can understand without any doubt the position of Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and can fix his mind in the worship of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a without deviation. The Lord is all-pervading by the expansion of His partial representation, the Supersoul, who enters into everything that is. Pure devotees, therefore, concentrate their minds in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness in full devotional service; therefore they are always situated in the transcendental position. Devotional service and worship of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a are very clearly indicated in this chapter in verses 8 through 11. That is the way of pure devotional service. How one can attain the highest devotional perfection of association with the Supreme Personality of Godhead has been thoroughly explained in this chapter. \u015ar\u012bla Baladeva Vidy\u0101bh\u016b\u1e63a\u1e47a, a great \u0101c\u0101rya in disciplic succession from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, concludes his commentary on this chapter by saying,yac-chakti-le\u015b\u0101t s\u016bry\u0101dy\u0101bhavanty aty-ugra-tejasa\u1e25yad-a\u1e41\u015bena dh\u1e5bta\u1e41 vi\u015bva\u1e41sa k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47o da\u015bame \u2019rcyateFrom Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s potent energy even the powerful sun gets its power, and by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s partial expansion the whole world is maintained. Therefore Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is worshipable.Thus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Tenth Chapter of the \u015ar\u012bmad Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 in the matter of the Opulence of the Absolute."}
