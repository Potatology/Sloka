He is therefore the greatest of personalities. Now it is clear here that the living entities and the Supreme Personality of Godhead are individuals. The difference is that the living entities, either in the conditioned state or in the liberated state, cannot surpass in quantity the inconceivable potencies of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. It is incorrect to think of the Supreme Lord and the living entities as being on the same level or equal in all respects. There is always the question of superiority and inferiority between their personalities. The word uttama is very significant. No one can surpass the Supreme Personality of Godhead.The word loke signifies \u201cin the pauru\u1e63a \u0101gama (the sm\u1e5bti scriptures).\u201d As confirmed in the Nirukti dictionary, lokyate ved\u0101rtho \u2019nena: \u201cThe purpose of the Vedas is explained by the sm\u1e5bti scriptures.\u201dThe Supreme Lord, in His localized aspect of Param\u0101tm\u0101, is also described in the Vedas themselves. The following verse appears in the Vedas (Ch\u0101ndogya Upani\u1e63ad 8.12.3): t\u0101vad e\u1e63a sampras\u0101do \u2019sm\u0101c char\u012br\u0101t samutth\u0101ya para\u1e41 jyoti-r\u016bpa\u1e41 sampadya svena r\u016bpe\u1e47\u0101bhini\u1e63padyate sa uttama\u1e25 puru\u1e63a\u1e25. \u201cThe Supersoul coming out of the body enters the impersonal brahma-jyotir; then in His form He remains in His spiritual identity. That Supreme is called the Supreme Personality.\u201d This means that the Supreme Personality is exhibiting and diffusing His spiritual effulgence, which is the ultimate illumination. That Supreme Personality also has a localized aspect as Param\u0101tm\u0101. By incarnating Himself as the son of Satyavat\u012b and Par\u0101\u015bara, He explains the Vedic knowledge as Vy\u0101sadeva."}
