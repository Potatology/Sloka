But they do not know the formula for peace, which is explained in this part of the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. The greatest peace formula is simply this: Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the beneficiary in all human activities. Men should offer everything to the transcendental service of the Lord because He is the proprietor of all planets and the demigods thereon. No one is greater than He. He is greater than the greatest of the demigods, Lord \u015aiva and Lord Brahm\u0101. In the Vedas (\u015avet\u0101\u015bvatara Upani\u1e63ad 6.7) the Supreme Lord is described as tam \u012b\u015bvar\u0101\u1e47\u0101\u1e41 parama\u1e41 mahe\u015bvara\u1e41. Under the spell of illusion, living entities are trying to be lords of all they survey, but actually they are dominated by the material energy of the Lord. The Lord is the master of material nature, and the conditioned souls are under the stringent rules of material nature. Unless one understands these bare facts, it is not possible to achieve peace in the world either individually or collectively. This is the sense of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness: Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the supreme predominator, and all living entities, including the great demigods, are His subordinates. One can attain perfect peace only in complete K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.This Fifth Chapter is a practical explanation of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, generally known as karma-yoga. The question of mental speculation as to how karma-yoga can give liberation is answered herewith. To work in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is to work with the complete knowledge of the Lord as the predominator. Such work is not different from transcendental knowledge. Direct K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is bhakti-yoga, and j\u00f1\u0101na-yoga is a path leading to bhakti-yoga. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness means to work in full knowledge of one\u2019s relationship with the Supreme Absolute, and the perfection of this consciousness is full knowledge of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead. A pure soul is the eternal servant of God as His fragmental part and parcel. He comes into contact with m\u0101y\u0101 (illusion) due to the desire to lord it over m\u0101y\u0101, and that is the cause of his many sufferings. As long as he is in contact with matter, he has to execute work in terms of material necessities. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, however, brings one into spiritual life even while one is within the jurisdiction of matter, for it is an arousing of spiritual existence by practice in the material world. The more one is advanced, the more he is freed from the clutches of matter. The Lord is not partial toward anyone. Everything depends on one\u2019s practical performance of duties in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, which helps one control the senses in every respect and conquer the influence of desire and anger. And one who stands fast in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, controlling the abovementioned passions, remains factually in the transcendental stage, or brahma-nirv\u0101\u1e47a. The eightfold yoga mysticism is automatically practiced in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness because the ultimate purpose is served. There is a gradual process of elevation in the practice of yama, niyama, \u0101sana, pr\u0101\u1e47\u0101y\u0101ma, praty\u0101h\u0101ra, dh\u0101ra\u1e47\u0101, dhy\u0101na and sam\u0101dhi. But these only preface perfection by devotional service, which alone can award peace to the human being. It is the highest perfection of life.Thus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Fifth Chapter of the \u015ar\u012bmad Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 in the matter of Karma-yoga, or Action in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Consciousness."}
