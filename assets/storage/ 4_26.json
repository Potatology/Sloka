Since human life is not meant for our enjoying sense gratification like the animals, the four orders of human life are so arranged that one may become perfect in spiritual life. The brahmac\u0101r\u012bs, or students under the care of a bona fide spiritual master, control the mind by abstaining from sense gratification. A brahmac\u0101r\u012b hears only words concerning K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness; hearing is the basic principle for understanding, and therefore the pure brahmac\u0101r\u012b engages fully in harer n\u0101m\u0101nuk\u012brtanam \u2013 chanting and hearing the glories of the Lord. He restrains himself from the vibrations of material sounds, and his hearing is engaged in the transcendental sound vibration of Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Similarly, the householders, who have some license for sense gratification, perform such acts with great restraint. Sex life, intoxication and meat-eating are general tendencies of human society, but a regulated householder does not indulge in unrestricted sex life and other sense gratification. Marriage on the principles of religious life is therefore current in all civilized human society because that is the way for restricted sex life. This restricted, unattached sex life is also a kind of yaj\u00f1a because the restricted householder sacrifices his general tendency toward sense gratification for higher, transcendental life."}
