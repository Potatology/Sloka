Now learn of these from Me.O mighty-armed Arjuna, according to the Ved\u0101nta there are five causes for the accomplishment of all action. Now learn of these from Me.PurportA question may be raised that since any activity performed must have some reaction, how is it that the person in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness does not suffer or enjoy the reactions of work? The Lord is citing Ved\u0101nta philosophy to show how this is possible. He says that there are five causes for all activities, and for success in all activity one should consider these five causes. S\u0101\u1e45khya means the stock of knowledge, and Ved\u0101nta is the final stock of knowledge accepted by all leading \u0101c\u0101ryas. Even \u015aa\u1e45kara accepts Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra as such. Therefore such authority should be consulted.The ultimate control is invested in the Supersoul. As it is stated in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, sarvasya c\u0101ha\u1e41 h\u1e5bdi sannivi\u1e63\u1e6da\u1e25. He is engaging everyone in certain activities by reminding him of his past actions. And K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious acts done under His direction from within yield no reaction, either in this life or in the life after death."}
