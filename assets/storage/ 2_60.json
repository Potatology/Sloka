Even Vi\u015bv\u0101mitra, a great sage and perfect yog\u012b, was misled by Menak\u0101 into sex enjoyment, although the yog\u012b was endeavoring for sense control with severe types of penance and yoga practice. And, of course, there are so many similar instances in the history of the world. Therefore, it is very difficult to control the mind and senses without being fully K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious. Without engaging the mind in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, one cannot cease such material engagements. A practical example is given by \u015ar\u012b Y\u0101mun\u0101c\u0101rya, a great saint and devotee, who says:yad-avadhi mama ceta\u1e25 k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-p\u0101d\u0101ravindenava-nava-rasa-dh\u0101many udyata\u1e41 rantum \u0101s\u012bttad-avadhi bata n\u0101r\u012b-sa\u1e45game smaryam\u0101nebhavati mukha-vik\u0101ra\u1e25 su\u1e63\u1e6dhu ni\u1e63\u1e6dh\u012bvana\u1e41 ca\u201cSince my mind has been engaged in the service of the lotus feet of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and I have been enjoying an ever new transcendental humor, whenever I think of sex life with a woman, my face at once turns from it, and I spit at the thought.\u201dK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is such a transcendentally nice thing that automatically material enjoyment becomes distasteful. It is as if a hungry man had satisfied his hunger by a sufficient quantity of nutritious eatables. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Ambar\u012b\u1e63a also conquered a great yog\u012b, Durv\u0101s\u0101 Muni, simply because his mind was engaged in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness (sa vai mana\u1e25 k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-pad\u0101ravindayor vac\u0101\u1e41si vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha-gu\u1e47\u0101nuvar\u1e47ane)."}
