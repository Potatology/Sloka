In other words, desire for becoming K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious is actually desirelessness. To understand one\u2019s actual position as the eternal servitor of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, without falsely claiming this material body to be oneself and without falsely claiming proprietorship over anything in the world, is the perfect stage of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. One who is situated in this perfect stage knows that because K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the proprietor of everything, everything must be used for the satisfaction of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Arjuna did not want to fight for his own sense satisfaction, but when he became fully K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious he fought because K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a wanted him to fight. For himself there was no desire to fight, but for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a the same Arjuna fought to his best ability. Real desirelessness is desire for the satisfaction of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, not an artificial attempt to abolish desires. The living entity cannot be desireless or senseless, but he does have to change the quality of the desires. A materially desireless person certainly knows that everything belongs to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a (\u012b\u015b\u0101v\u0101syam ida\u1e41 sarvam), and therefore he does not falsely claim proprietorship over anything. This transcendental knowledge is based on self-realization \u2013 namely, knowing perfectly well that every living entity is an eternal part and parcel of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in spiritual identity, and that the eternal position of the living entity is therefore never on the level of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a or greater than Him. This understanding of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is the basic principle of real peace."}
