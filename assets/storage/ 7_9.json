I am the life of all that lives, and I am the penances of all ascetics.I am the original fragrance of the earth, and I am the heat in fire. I am the life of all that lives, and I am the penances of all ascetics.PurportPu\u1e47ya means that which is not decomposed; pu\u1e47ya is original. Everything in the material world has a certain flavor or fragrance, as the flavor and fragrance in a flower, or in the earth, in water, in fire, in air, etc. The uncontaminated flavor, the original flavor, which permeates everything, is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Similarly, everything has a particular original taste, and this taste can be changed by the mixture of chemicals. So everything original has some smell, some fragrance and some taste. Vibh\u0101vasu means fire. Without fire we cannot run factories, we cannot cook, etc., and that fire is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The heat in the fire is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. According to Vedic medicine, indigestion is due to a low temperature in the belly. So even for digestion fire is needed. In K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness we become aware that earth, water, fire, air and every active principle, all chemicals and all material elements are due to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The duration of man\u2019s life is also due to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Therefore by the grace of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, man can prolong his life or diminish it. So K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is active in every sphere."}
