They are fully engaged in devotional service because they know Me as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, original and inexhaustible.O son of P\u1e5bth\u0101, those who are not deluded, the great souls, are under the protection of the divine nature. They are fully engaged in devotional service because they know Me as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, original and inexhaustible.PurportIn this verse the description of the mah\u0101tm\u0101 is clearly given. The first sign of the mah\u0101tm\u0101 is that he is already situated in the divine nature. He is not under the control of material nature. And how is this effected? That is explained in the Seventh Chapter: one who surrenders unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, at once becomes freed from the control of material nature. That is the qualification. One can become free from the control of material nature as soon as he surrenders his soul to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. That is the preliminary formula. Being marginal potency, as soon as the living entity is freed from the control of material nature, he is put under the guidance of the spiritual nature. The guidance of the spiritual nature is called daiv\u012b prak\u1e5bti, divine nature. So when one is promoted in that way \u2013 by surrendering to the Supreme Personality of Godhead \u2013 one attains to the stage of great soul, mah\u0101tm\u0101.The mah\u0101tm\u0101 does not divert his attention to anything outside K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, because he knows perfectly well that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the original Supreme Person, the cause of all causes. There is no doubt about it. Such a mah\u0101tm\u0101, or great soul, develops through association with other mah\u0101tm\u0101s, pure devotees. Pure devotees are not even attracted by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s other features, such as the four-armed Mah\u0101-vi\u1e63\u1e47u. They are simply attracted by the two-armed form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. They are not attracted to other features of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, nor are they concerned with any form of a demigod or of a human being. They meditate only upon K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. They are always engaged in the unswerving service of the Lord in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness."}
