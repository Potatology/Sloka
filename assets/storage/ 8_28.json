Simply by performing devotional service, he attains all these, and at the end he reaches the supreme eternal abode.A person who accepts the path of devotional service is not bereft of the results derived from studying the Vedas, performing sacrifices, undergoing austerities, giving charity or pursuing philosophical and fruitive activities. Simply by performing devotional service, he attains all these, and at the end he reaches the supreme eternal abode.PurportThis verse is the summation of the Seventh and Eighth chapters, which particularly deal with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and devotional service. One has to study the Vedas under the guidance of the spiritual master and undergo many austerities and penances while living under his care. A brahmac\u0101r\u012b has to live in the home of the spiritual master just like a servant, and he must beg alms from door to door and bring them to the spiritual master. He takes food only under the master\u2019s order, and if the master neglects to call the student for food that day, the student fasts. These are some of the Vedic principles for observing brahmacarya.After the student studies the Vedas under the master for some time \u2013 at least from age five to twenty \u2013 he becomes a man of perfect character. Study of the Vedas is not meant for the recreation of armchair speculators, but for the formation of character. After this training, the brahmac\u0101r\u012b is allowed to enter into household life and marry. When he is a householder, he has to perform many sacrifices so that he may achieve further enlightenment. He must also give charity according to the country, time and candidate, discriminating among charity in goodness, in passion and in ignorance, as described in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. Then after retiring from household life, upon accepting the order of v\u0101naprastha, he undergoes severe penances \u2013 living in forests, dressing with tree bark, not shaving, etc. By carrying out the orders of brahmacarya, householder life, v\u0101naprastha and finally sanny\u0101sa, one becomes elevated to the perfectional stage of life. Some are then elevated to the heavenly kingdoms, and when they become even more advanced they are liberated in the spiritual sky, either in the impersonal brahma-jyotir or in the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha planets or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47aloka. This is the path outlined by Vedic literatures.The beauty of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, however, is that by one stroke, by engaging in devotional service, one can surpass all the rituals of the different orders of life.The words ida\u1e41 viditv\u0101 indicate that one should understand the instructions given by \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in this chapter and the Seventh Chapter of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. One should try to understand these chapters not by scholarship or mental speculation but by hearing them in association with devotees. Chapters Seven through Twelve are the essence of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. The first six and the last six chapters are like coverings for the middle six chapters, which are especially protected by the Lord. If one is fortunate enough to understand Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 \u2013 especially these middle six chapters \u2013 in the association of devotees, then his life at once becomes glorified beyond all penances, sacrifices, charities, speculations, etc., for one can achieve all the results of these activities simply by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.One who has a little faith in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 should learn Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 from a devotee, because in the beginning of the Fourth Chapter it is stated clearly that Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 can be understood only by devotees; no one else can perfectly understand the purpose of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. One should therefore learn Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 from a devotee of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, not from mental speculators. This is a sign of faith. When one searches for a devotee and fortunately gets a devotee\u2019s association one actually begins to study and understand Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. By advancement in the association of the devotee one is placed in devotional service, and this service dispels all one\u2019s misgivings about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, or God, and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s activities, form, pastimes, name and other features. After these misgivings have been perfectly cleared away, one becomes fixed in one\u2019s study. Then one relishes the study of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 and attains the state of feeling always K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious. In the advanced stage, one falls completely in love with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. This highest perfectional stage of life enables the devotee to be transferred to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s abode in the spiritual sky, Goloka V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, where the devotee becomes eternally happy.Thus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Eighth Chapter of the \u015ar\u012bmad Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 in the matter of Attaining the Supreme."}
