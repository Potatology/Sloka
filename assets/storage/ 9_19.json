I am immortality, and I am also death personified. Both spirit and matter are in Me.O Arjuna, I give heat, and I withhold and send forth the rain. I am immortality, and I am also death personified. Both spirit and matter are in Me.PurportK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, by His different energies, diffuses heat and light through the agency of electricity and the sun. During the summer season it is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a who checks rain from falling from the sky, and then during the rainy season He gives unceasing torrents of rain. The energy which sustains us by prolonging the duration of our life is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a meets us at the end as death. By analyzing all these different energies of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, one can ascertain that for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a there is no distinction between matter and spirit, or, in other words, He is both matter and spirit. In the advanced stage of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, one therefore makes no such distinctions. He sees only K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in everything.Since K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is both matter and spirit, the gigantic universal form comprising all material manifestations is also K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and His pastimes in V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana as two-handed \u015ay\u0101masundara, playing on a flute, are those of the Supreme Personality of Godhead."}
