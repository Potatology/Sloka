Dro\u1e47\u0101c\u0101rya had some political quarrel with King Drupada, the father of Draupad\u012b, who was Arjuna\u2019s wife. As a result of this quarrel, Drupada performed a great sacrifice, by which he received the benediction of having a son who would be able to kill Dro\u1e47\u0101c\u0101rya. Dro\u1e47\u0101c\u0101rya knew this perfectly well, and yet as a liberal br\u0101hma\u1e47a he did not hesitate to impart all his military secrets when the son of Drupada, Dh\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6dadyumna, was entrusted to him for military education. Now, on the Battlefield of Kuruk\u1e63etra, Dh\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6dadyumna took the side of the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas, and it was he who arranged for their military phalanx, after having learned the art from Dro\u1e47\u0101c\u0101rya. Duryodhana pointed out this mistake of Dro\u1e47\u0101c\u0101rya\u2019s so that he might be alert and uncompromising in the fighting. By this he wanted to point out also that he should not be similarly lenient in battle against the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas, who were also Dro\u1e47\u0101c\u0101rya\u2019s affectionate students. Arjuna, especially, was his most affectionate and brilliant student. Duryodhana also warned that such leniency in the fight would lead to defeat."}
