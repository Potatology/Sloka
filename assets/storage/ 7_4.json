Material nature is called prak\u1e5bti, or the energy of the Lord in His different puru\u1e63a incarnations (expansions) as described in the N\u0101rada Pa\u00f1car\u0101tra, one of the S\u0101tvata-tantras:vi\u1e63\u1e47os tu tr\u012b\u1e47i r\u016bp\u0101\u1e47ipuru\u1e63\u0101khy\u0101ny atho vidu\u1e25eka\u1e41 tu mahata\u1e25 sra\u1e63\u1e6d\u1e5bdvit\u012bya\u1e41 tv a\u1e47\u1e0da-sa\u1e41sthitamt\u1e5bt\u012bya\u1e41 sarva-bh\u016bta-stha\u1e41t\u0101ni j\u00f1\u0101tv\u0101 vimucyate\u201cFor material creation, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s plenary expansion assumes three Vi\u1e63\u1e47us. The first one, Mah\u0101-vi\u1e63\u1e47u, creates the total material energy, known as the mahat-tattva. The second, Garbhodaka-\u015b\u0101y\u012b Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, enters into all the universes to create diversities in each of them. The third, K\u1e63\u012brodaka-\u015b\u0101y\u012b Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, is diffused as the all-pervading Supersoul in all the universes and is known as Param\u0101tm\u0101. He is present even within the atoms. Anyone who knows these three Vi\u1e63\u1e47us can be liberated from material entanglement.\u201dThis material world is a temporary manifestation of one of the energies of the Lord. All the activities of the material world are directed by these three Vi\u1e63\u1e47u expansions of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. These puru\u1e63as are called incarnations. Generally one who does not know the science of God (K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a) assumes that this material world is for the enjoyment of the living entities and that the living entities are the puru\u1e63as \u2013 the causes, controllers and enjoyers of the material energy. According to Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 this atheistic conclusion is false. In the verse under discussion it is stated that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the original cause of the material manifestation. \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam also confirms this. The ingredients of the material manifestation are separated energies of the Lord. Even the brahma-jyotir, which is the ultimate goal of the impersonalists, is a spiritual energy manifested in the spiritual sky. There are no spiritual diversities in the brahma-jyotir as there are in the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha-lokas, and the impersonalist accepts this brahma-jyotir as the ultimate eternal goal. The Param\u0101tm\u0101 manifestation is also a temporary all-pervasive aspect of the K\u1e63\u012brodaka-\u015b\u0101y\u012b Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. The Param\u0101tm\u0101 manifestation is not eternal in the spiritual world. Therefore the factual Absolute Truth is the Supreme Personality of Godhead K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. He is the complete energetic person, and He possesses different separated and internal energies.In the material energy, the principal manifestations are eight, as above mentioned. Out of these, the first five manifestations, namely earth, water, fire, air and sky, are called the five gigantic creations or the gross creations, within which the five sense objects are included. They are the manifestations of physical sound, touch, form, taste and smell. Material science comprises these ten items and nothing more. But the other three items, namely mind, intelligence and false ego, are neglected by the materialists. Philosophers who deal with mental activities are also not perfect in knowledge because they do not know the ultimate source, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The false ego \u2013 \u201cI am,\u201d and \u201cIt is mine,\u201d which constitute the basic principle of material existence \u2013 includes ten sense organs for material activities. Intelligence refers to the total material creation, called the mahat-tattva. Therefore from the eight separated energies of the Lord are manifest the twenty-four elements of the material world, which are the subject matter of S\u0101\u1e45khya atheistic philosophy; they are originally offshoots from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s energies and are separated from Him, but atheistic S\u0101\u1e45khya philosophers with a poor fund of knowledge do not know K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as the cause of all causes. The subject matter for discussion in the S\u0101\u1e45khya philosophy is only the manifestation of the external energy of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, as it is described in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101."}
