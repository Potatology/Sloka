By K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s grace, Arjuna has personal experience, intelligence and knowledge and whatever else a person may have, and through all these agencies he has understood K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to be the Supreme Personality of Godhead. For him there is no doubt, yet he is asking K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to explain His all-pervading nature. People in general and the impersonalists in particular concern themselves mainly with the all-pervading nature of the Supreme. So Arjuna is asking K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a how He exists in His all-pervading aspect through His different energies. One should know that this is being asked by Arjuna on behalf of the common people."}
