Even the modern scientists who do not believe in the existence of the soul, but at the same time cannot explain the source of energy from the heart, have to accept continuous changes of body which appear from childhood to boyhood and from boyhood to youth and again from youth to old age. From old age, the change is transferred to another body. This has already been explained in a previous verse (2.13).Transference of the atomic individual soul to another body is made possible by the grace of the Supersoul. The Supersoul fulfills the desire of the atomic soul as one friend fulfills the desire of another. The Vedas, like the Mu\u1e47\u1e0daka Upani\u1e63ad, as well as the \u015avet\u0101\u015bvatara Upani\u1e63ad, compare the soul and the Supersoul to two friendly birds sitting on the same tree. One of the birds (the individual atomic soul) is eating the fruit of the tree, and the other bird (K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a) is simply watching His friend. Of these two birds \u2013 although they are the same in quality \u2013 one is captivated by the fruits of the material tree, while the other is simply witnessing the activities of His friend. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the witnessing bird, and Arjuna is the eating bird. Although they are friends, one is still the master and the other is the servant. Forgetfulness of this relationship by the atomic soul is the cause of one\u2019s changing his position from one tree to another, or from one body to another. The j\u012bva soul is struggling very hard on the tree of the material body, but as soon as he agrees to accept the other bird as the supreme spiritual master \u2013 as Arjuna agreed to do by voluntary surrender unto K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a for instruction \u2013 the subordinate bird immediately becomes free from all lamentations. Both the Mu\u1e47\u1e0daka Upani\u1e63ad (3.1.2) and \u015avet\u0101\u015bvatara Upani\u1e63ad (4.7) confirm this:sam\u0101ne v\u1e5bk\u1e63e puru\u1e63o nimagno\u2019n\u012b\u015bay\u0101 \u015bocati muhyam\u0101na\u1e25ju\u1e63\u1e6da\u1e41 yad\u0101 pa\u015byaty anyam \u012b\u015bamasya mahim\u0101nam iti v\u012bta-\u015boka\u1e25\u201cAlthough the two birds are in the same tree, the eating bird is fully engrossed with anxiety and moroseness as the enjoyer of the fruits of the tree. But if in some way or other he turns his face to his friend the Lord and knows His glories \u2013 at once the suffering bird becomes free from all anxieties.\u201d Arjuna has now turned his face towards his eternal friend, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and is understanding the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 from Him. And thus, hearing from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, he can understand the supreme glories of the Lord and be free from lamentation.Arjuna is advised herewith by the Lord not to lament for the bodily change of his old grandfather and his teacher. He should rather be happy to kill their bodies in the righteous fight so that they may be cleansed at once of all reactions from various bodily activities. One who lays down his life on the sacrificial altar, or in the proper battlefield, is at once cleansed of bodily reactions and promoted to a higher status of life. So there was no cause for Arjuna\u2019s lamentation."}
