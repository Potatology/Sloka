Hear this from Me, for it is for your benefit.PurportThe Lord has given Arjuna knowledge that is confidential (knowledge of Brahman) and still more confidential (knowledge of the Supersoul within everyone\u2019s heart), and now He is giving the most confidential part of knowledge: just surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead. At the end of the Ninth Chapter He has said, man-man\u0101\u1e25: \u201cJust always think of Me.\u201d The same instruction is repeated here to stress the essence of the teachings of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. This essence is not understood by a common man, but by one who is actually very dear to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, a pure devotee of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. This is the most important instruction in all Vedic literature. What K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is saying in this connection is the most essential part of knowledge, and it should be carried out not only by Arjuna but by all living entities."}
