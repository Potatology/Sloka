Gu\u1e0d\u0101k\u0101 means sleep, and one who conquers sleep is called gu\u1e0d\u0101ke\u015ba. Sleep also means ignorance. So Arjuna conquered both sleep and ignorance because of his friendship with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. As a great devotee of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, he could not forget K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a even for a moment, because that is the nature of a devotee. Either in waking or in sleep, a devotee of the Lord can never be free from thinking of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s name, form, qualities and pastimes. Thus a devotee of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a can conquer both sleep and ignorance simply by thinking of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a constantly. This is called K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, or sam\u0101dhi. As H\u1e5b\u1e63\u012bke\u015ba, or the director of the senses and mind of every living entity, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a could understand Arjuna\u2019s purpose in placing the chariot in the midst of the armies. Thus He did so, and spoke as follows."}
