The supreme planet is described in Vedic literature as avyakta and ak\u1e63ara and param\u0101 gati; in other words, that planet is beyond our material vision, and it is inexplicable, but it is the highest goal, the destination for the mah\u0101tm\u0101s (great souls). The mah\u0101tm\u0101s receive transcendental messages from the realized devotees and thus gradually develop devotional service in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and become so absorbed in transcendental service that they no longer desire elevation to any of the material planets, nor do they even want to be transferred to any spiritual planet. They only want K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s association, and nothing else. That is the highest perfection of life. This verse specifically mentions the personalist devotees of the Supreme Lord, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. These devotees in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness achieve the highest perfection of life. In other words, they are the supreme souls."}
