This is the transcendental position of spiritual life. In other words, one who hears the G\u012bt\u0101 from the right source, directly from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, attains full K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. The result of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is that one becomes increasingly enlightened, and he enjoys life with a thrill, not only for some time, but at every moment."}
