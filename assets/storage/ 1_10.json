He thinks that the strength of his armed forces is immeasurable, being specifically protected by the most experienced general, Grandfather Bh\u012b\u1e63ma. On the other hand, the forces of the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas are limited, being protected by a less experienced general, Bh\u012bma, who is like a fig in the presence of Bh\u012b\u1e63ma. Duryodhana was always envious of Bh\u012bma because he knew perfectly well that if he should die at all, he would only be killed by Bh\u012bma. But at the same time, he was confident of his victory on account of the presence of Bh\u012b\u1e63ma, who was a far superior general. His conclusion that he would come out of the battle victorious was well ascertained."}
