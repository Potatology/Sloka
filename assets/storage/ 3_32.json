As there is punishment for disobedience to the order of the supreme executive head, so there is certainly punishment for disobedience to the order of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. A disobedient person, however great he may be, is ignorant of his own self, and of the Supreme Brahman, Param\u0101tm\u0101 and the Personality of Godhead, due to a vacant heart. Therefore there is no hope of perfection of life for him."}
