It is said that every muni has a different angle of vision, and unless a muni differs from other munis, he cannot be called a muni in the strict sense of the term. N\u0101s\u0101v \u1e5b\u1e63ir yasya mata\u1e41 na bhinnam (Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata, Vana-parva 313.117). But a sthita-dh\u012br muni, as mentioned herein by the Lord, is different from an ordinary muni. The sthita-dh\u012br muni is always in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, for he has exhausted all his business of creative speculation. He is called pra\u015b\u0101nta-ni\u1e25\u015be\u1e63a-mano-rath\u0101ntara (Stotra-ratna 43), or one who has surpassed the stage of mental speculations and has come to the conclusion that Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, or V\u0101sudeva, is everything (v\u0101sudeva\u1e25 sarvam iti sa mah\u0101tm\u0101 su-durlabha\u1e25). He is called a muni fixed in mind. Such a fully K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person is not at all disturbed by the onslaughts of the threefold miseries, for he accepts all miseries as the mercy of the Lord, thinking himself only worthy of more trouble due to his past misdeeds; and he sees that his miseries, by the grace of the Lord, are minimized to the lowest. Similarly, when he is happy he gives credit to the Lord, thinking himself unworthy of the happiness; he realizes that it is due only to the Lord\u2019s grace that he is in such a comfortable condition and able to render better service to the Lord. And, for the service of the Lord, he is always daring and active and is not influenced by attachment or aversion. Attachment means accepting things for one\u2019s own sense gratification, and detachment is the absence of such sensual attachment. But one fixed in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness has neither attachment nor detachment because his life is dedicated in the service of the Lord. Consequently he is not at all angry even when his attempts are unsuccessful. Success or no success, a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person is always steady in his determination."}
