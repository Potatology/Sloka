This snake bed is called V\u0101suki. There are also other snakes known as V\u0101suki. Arjuna can see from the Garbhodaka-\u015b\u0101y\u012b Vi\u1e63\u1e47u up to the topmost part of the universe on the lotus-flower planet where Brahm\u0101, the first creature of the universe, resides. That means that from the beginning to the end, everything could be seen by Arjuna, who was sitting in one place on his chariot. This was possible by the grace of the Supreme Lord, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a."}
