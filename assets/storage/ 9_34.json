Being completely absorbed in Me, surely you will come to Me.Engage your mind always in thinking of Me, become My devotee, offer obeisances to Me and worship Me. Being completely absorbed in Me, surely you will come to Me.PurportIn this verse it is clearly indicated that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is the only means of being delivered from the clutches of this contaminated material world. Sometimes unscrupulous commentators distort the meaning of what is clearly stated here: that all devotional service should be offered to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Unfortunately, unscrupulous commentators divert the mind of the reader to that which is not at all feasible. Such commentators do not know that there is no difference between K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s mind and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is not an ordinary human being; He is Absolute Truth. His body, His mind and He Himself are one and absolute. It is stated in the K\u016brma Pur\u0101\u1e47a, as it is quoted by Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b Gosv\u0101m\u012b in his Anubh\u0101\u1e63ya comments on Caitanya-carit\u0101m\u1e5bta (Fifth Chapter, \u0100di-l\u012bl\u0101, verses 41\u201348), deha-dehi-vibhedo \u2019ya\u1e41 ne\u015bvare vidyate kvacit. This means that there is no difference in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme Lord, between Himself and His body. But because the commentators do not know this science of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, they hide K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and divide His personality from His mind or from His body. Although this is sheer ignorance of the science of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, some men make profit out of misleading people.There are some who are demonic; they also think of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, but enviously, just like King Ka\u1e41sa, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s uncle. He was also thinking of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a always, but he thought of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as his enemy. He was always in anxiety, wondering when K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a would come to kill him. That kind of thinking will not help us. One should be thinking of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in devotional love. That is bhakti. One should cultivate the knowledge of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a continuously. What is that favorable cultivation? It is to learn from a bona fide teacher. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and we have several times explained that His body is not material, but is eternal, blissful knowledge. This kind of talk about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a will help one become a devotee. Understanding K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a otherwise, from the wrong source, will prove fruitless.One should therefore engage his mind in the eternal form, the primal form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a; with conviction in his heart that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme, he should engage himself in worship. There are hundreds of thousands of temples in India for the worship of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and devotional service is practiced there. When such practice is made, one has to offer obeisances to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. One should lower his head before the Deity and engage his mind, his body, his activities \u2013 everything. That will make one fully absorbed in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a without deviation. This will help one transfer to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47aloka. One should not be deviated by unscrupulous commentators. One must engage in the nine different processes of devotional service, beginning with hearing and chanting about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Pure devotional service is the highest achievement of human society.The Seventh and Eighth chapters of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 have explained pure devotional service to the Lord that is free from speculative knowledge, mystic yoga and fruitive activities. Those who are not purely sanctified may be attracted by different features of the Lord like the impersonal brahma-jyotir and localized Param\u0101tm\u0101, but a pure devotee directly takes to the service of the Supreme Lord.There is a beautiful poem about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in which it is clearly stated that any person who is engaged in the worship of demigods is most unintelligent and cannot achieve at any time the supreme award of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The devotee, in the beginning, may sometimes fall from the standard, but still he should be considered superior to all other philosophers and yog\u012bs. One who always engages in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness should be understood to be a perfectly saintly person. His accidental nondevotional activities will diminish, and he will soon be situated without any doubt in complete perfection. The pure devotee has no actual chance to fall down, because the Supreme Godhead personally takes care of His pure devotees. Therefore, the intelligent person should take directly to the process of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and happily live in this material world. He will eventually receive the supreme award of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.Thus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Ninth Chapter of the \u015ar\u012bmad Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 in the matter of the Most Confidential Knowledge."}
