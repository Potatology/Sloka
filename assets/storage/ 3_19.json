A person, therefore, acting for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, or in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, under proper guidance and without attachment to the result of the work, is certainly making progress toward the supreme goal of life. Arjuna is told that he should fight in the Battle of Kuruk\u1e63etra for the interest of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a because K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a wanted him to fight. To be a good man or a nonviolent man is a personal attachment, but to act on behalf of the Supreme is to act without attachment for the result. That is perfect action of the highest degree, recommended by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.Vedic rituals, like prescribed sacrifices, are performed for purification of impious activities that were performed in the field of sense gratification. But action in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is transcendental to the reactions of good or evil work. A K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person has no attachment for the result but acts on behalf of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a alone. He engages in all kinds of activities, but is completely nonattached."}
