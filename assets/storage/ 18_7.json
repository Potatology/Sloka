It is said that a person in the renounced order of life should not cook for himself. Cooking for oneself is prohibited, but cooking for the Supreme Lord is not prohibited. Similarly, a sanny\u0101s\u012b may perform a marriage ceremony to help his disciple in the advancement of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. If one renounces such activities, it is to be understood that he is acting in the mode of darkness."}
