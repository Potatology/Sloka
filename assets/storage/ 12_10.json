How to do this work has already been explained in the fifty-fifth verse of the Eleventh Chapter. One should be sympathetic to the propagation of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. There are many devotees who are engaged in the propagation of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, and they require help. So, even if one cannot directly practice the regulative principles of bhakti-yoga, he can try to help such work. Every endeavor requires land, capital, organization and labor. Just as in business one requires a place to stay, some capital to use, some labor and some organization to expand, so the same is required in the service of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The only difference is that in materialism one works for sense gratification. The same work, however, can be performed for the satisfaction of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and that is spiritual activity. If one has sufficient money, he can help in building an office or temple for propagating K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Or he can help with publications. There are various fields of activity, and one should be interested in such activities. If one cannot sacrifice the results of his activities, the same person can still sacrifice some percentage to propagate K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. This voluntary service to the cause of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness will help one to rise to a higher state of love for God, whereupon one becomes perfect."}
