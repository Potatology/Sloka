In the Yoga-s\u016btra of Pata\u00f1jali, the soul is called pratyag-\u0101tm\u0101 and par\u0101g-\u0101tm\u0101. As long as the soul is attached to sense enjoyment it is called par\u0101g-\u0101tm\u0101, but as soon as the same soul becomes detached from such sense enjoyment it is called pratyag-\u0101tm\u0101. The soul is subjected to the functions of ten kinds of air at work within the body, and this is perceived through the breathing system. The Pata\u00f1jali system of yoga instructs one on how to control the functions of the body\u2019s air in a technical manner so that ultimately all the functions of the air within become favorable for purifying the soul of material attachment. According to this yoga system, pratyag-\u0101tm\u0101 is the ultimate goal. This pratyag-\u0101tm\u0101 is withdrawn from activities in matter. The senses interact with the sense objects, like the ear for hearing, eyes for seeing, nose for smelling, tongue for tasting, and hand for touching, and all of them are thus engaged in activities outside the self. They are called the functions of the pr\u0101\u1e47a-v\u0101yu. The ap\u0101na-v\u0101yu goes downwards, vy\u0101na-v\u0101yu acts to shrink and expand, sam\u0101na-v\u0101yu adjusts equilibrium, ud\u0101na-v\u0101yu goes upwards \u2013 and when one is enlightened, one engages all these in searching for self-realization."}
