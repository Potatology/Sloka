The impersonal sound of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is o\u1e41, but the sound Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a contains o\u1e41. The chanting of the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mantra is clearly recommended for this age. So if one quits his body at the end of life chanting Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare, he certainly reaches one of the spiritual planets, according to the mode of his practice. The devotees of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a enter the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a planet, Goloka V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana. For the personalists there are also innumerable other planets, known as Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha planets, in the spiritual sky, whereas the impersonalists remain in the brahma-jyotir."}
