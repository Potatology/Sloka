Of lordly elephants I am Air\u0101vata, and among men I am the monarch.Of horses know Me to be Uccai\u1e25\u015brav\u0101, produced during the churning of the ocean for nectar. Of lordly elephants I am Air\u0101vata, and among men I am the monarch.PurportThe devotee demigods and the demons (asuras) once took part in churning the sea. From this churning, nectar and poison were produced, and Lord \u015aiva drank the poison. From the nectar were produced many entities, of which there was a horse named Uccai\u1e25\u015brav\u0101. Another animal produced from the nectar was an elephant named Air\u0101vata. Because these two animals were produced from nectar, they have special significance, and they are representatives of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.Amongst the human beings, the king is the representative of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a because K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the maintainer of the universe, and the kings, who are appointed on account of their godly qualifications, are maintainers of their kingdoms. Kings like Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira, Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Par\u012bk\u1e63it and Lord R\u0101ma were all highly righteous kings who always thought of the citizens\u2019 welfare. In Vedic literature, the king is considered to be the representative of God. In this age, however, with the corruption of the principles of religion, monarchy decayed and is now finally abolished. It is to be understood that in the past, however, people were more happy under righteous kings."}
