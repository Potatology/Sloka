That is my opinion.Wherever there is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the master of all mystics, and wherever there is Arjuna, the supreme archer, there will also certainly be opulence, victory, extraordinary power, and morality. That is my opinion.PurportThe Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 began with an inquiry of Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra\u2019s. He was hopeful of the victory of his sons, assisted by great warriors like Bh\u012b\u1e63ma, Dro\u1e47a and Kar\u1e47a. He was hopeful that the victory would be on his side. But after describing the scene on the battlefield, Sa\u00f1jaya told the King, \u201cYou are thinking of victory, but my opinion is that where K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and Arjuna are present, there will be all good fortune.\u201d He directly confirmed that Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra could not expect victory for his side. Victory was certain for the side of Arjuna because K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was there. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s acceptance of the post of charioteer for Arjuna was an exhibition of another opulence. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is full of all opulences, and renunciation is one of them. There are many instances of such renunciation, for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is also the master of renunciation.The fight was actually between Duryodhana and Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira. Arjuna was fighting on behalf of his elder brother, Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira. Because K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and Arjuna were on the side of Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira, Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira\u2019s victory was certain. The battle was to decide who would rule the world, and Sa\u00f1jaya predicted that the power would be transferred to Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira. It is also predicted here that Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira, after gaining victory in this battle, would flourish more and more because not only was he righteous and pious but he was also a strict moralist. He never spoke a lie during his life.There are many less intelligent persons who take Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 to be a discussion of topics between two friends on a battlefield. But such a book cannot be scripture. Some may protest that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a incited Arjuna to fight, which is immoral, but the reality of the situation is clearly stated: Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is the supreme instruction in morality. The supreme instruction of morality is stated in the Ninth Chapter, in the thirty-fourth verse: man-man\u0101 bhava mad-bhakta\u1e25. One must become a devotee of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and the essence of all religion is to surrender unto K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a (sarva-dharm\u0101n parityajya m\u0101m eka\u1e41 \u015bara\u1e47a\u1e41 vraja). The instructions of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 constitute the supreme process of religion and of morality. All other processes may be purifying and may lead to this process, but the last instruction of the G\u012bt\u0101 is the last word in all morality and religion: surrender unto K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. This is the verdict of the Eighteenth Chapter.From Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 we can understand that to realize oneself by philosophical speculation and by meditation is one process, but to fully surrender unto K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the highest perfection. This is the essence of the teachings of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. The path of regulative principles according to the orders of social life and according to the different courses of religion may be a confidential path of knowledge. But although the rituals of religion are confidential, meditation and cultivation of knowledge are still more confidential. And surrender unto K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in devotional service in full K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is the most confidential instruction. That is the essence of the Eighteenth Chapter.Another feature of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is that the actual truth is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The Absolute Truth is realized in three features \u2013 impersonal Brahman, localized Param\u0101tm\u0101, and ultimately the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Perfect knowledge of the Absolute Truth means perfect knowledge of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. If one understands K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, then all the departments of knowledge are part and parcel of that understanding. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is transcendental, for He is always situated in His eternal internal potency. The living entities are manifested of His energy and are divided into two classes, eternally conditioned and eternally liberated. Such living entities are innumerable, and they are considered fundamental parts of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Material energy is manifested into twenty-four divisions. The creation is effected by eternal time, and it is created and dissolved by external energy. This manifestation of the cosmic world repeatedly becomes visible and invisible.In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 five principal subject matters have been discussed: the Supreme Personality of Godhead, material nature, the living entities, eternal time and all kinds of activities. All is dependent on the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. All conceptions of the Absolute Truth \u2013 impersonal Brahman, localized Param\u0101tm\u0101 and any other transcendental conception \u2013 exist within the category of understanding the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Although superficially the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the living entity, material nature and time appear to be different, nothing is different from the Supreme. But the Supreme is always different from everything. Lord Caitanya\u2019s philosophy is that of \u201cinconceivable oneness and difference.\u201d This system of philosophy constitutes perfect knowledge of the Absolute Truth.The living entity in his original position is pure spirit. He is just like an atomic particle of the Supreme Spirit. Thus Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a may be compared to the sun, and the living entities to sunshine. Because the living entities are the marginal energy of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, they have a tendency to be in contact either with the material energy or with the spiritual energy. In other words, the living entity is situated between the two energies of the Lord, and because he belongs to the superior energy of the Lord, he has a particle of independence. By proper use of that independence he comes under the direct order of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Thus he attains his normal condition in the pleasure-giving potency.Thus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Eighteenth Chapter of the \u015ar\u012bmad Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 in the matter of its Conclusion \u2013 the Perfection of Renunciation."}
