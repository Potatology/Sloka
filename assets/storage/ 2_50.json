Therefore strive for yoga, which is the art of all work.PurportSince time immemorial each living entity has accumulated the various reactions of his good and bad work. As such, he is continuously ignorant of his real constitutional position. One\u2019s ignorance can be removed by the instruction of the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, which teaches one to surrender unto Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in all respects and become liberated from the chained victimization of action and reaction, birth after birth. Arjuna is therefore advised to act in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, the purifying process of resultant action."}
