But Sa\u00f1jaya disappointed him again in relating that Arjuna was competent to kill his enemies (paran-tapa\u1e25). Although Arjuna was, for the time being, overwhelmed with false grief due to family affection, he surrendered unto K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the supreme spiritual master, as a disciple. This indicated that he would soon be free from the false lamentation resulting from family affection and would be enlightened with perfect knowledge of self-realization, or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, and would then surely fight. Thus Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra\u2019s joy would be frustrated, since Arjuna would be enlightened by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and would fight to the end."}
