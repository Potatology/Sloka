There are various activities in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, and all of them will be described in the following verses. But, for the present, just the principle of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is described. A conditioned soul, entangled in material contamination, is sure to act in the material atmosphere, and yet he has to get out of such an environment. The process by which the conditioned soul can get out of the material atmosphere is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. For example, a patient who is suffering from a disorder of the bowels due to overindulgence in milk products is cured by another milk product, namely curds. The materially absorbed conditioned soul can be cured by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness as set forth here in the G\u012bt\u0101. This process is generally known as yaj\u00f1a, or activities (sacrifices) simply meant for the satisfaction of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The more the activities of the material world are performed in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, or for Vi\u1e63\u1e47u only, the more the atmosphere becomes spiritualized by complete absorption. The word brahma (Brahman) means \u201cspiritual.\u201d The Lord is spiritual, and the rays of His transcendental body are called brahma-jyotir, His spiritual effulgence. Everything that exists is situated in that brahma-jyotir, but when the jyotir is covered by illusion (m\u0101y\u0101) or sense gratification, it is called material. This material veil can be removed at once by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness; thus the offering for the sake of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, the consuming agent of such an offering or contribution, the process of consumption, the contributor and the result are \u2013 all combined together \u2013 Brahman, or the Absolute Truth. The Absolute Truth covered by m\u0101y\u0101 is called matter. Matter dovetailed for the cause of the Absolute Truth regains its spiritual quality. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is the process of converting the illusory consciousness into Brahman, or the Supreme. When the mind is fully absorbed in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, it is said to be in sam\u0101dhi, or trance. Anything done in such transcendental consciousness is called yaj\u00f1a, or sacrifice for the Absolute. In that condition of spiritual consciousness, the contributor, the contribution, the consumption, the performer or leader of the performance and the result or ultimate gain \u2013 everything \u2013 becomes one in the Absolute, the Supreme Brahman. That is the method of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness."}
