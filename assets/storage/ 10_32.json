Of all sciences I am the spiritual science of the self, and among logicians I am the conclusive truth.PurportAmong the created manifestations, the first is the creation of the total material elements. As explained before, the cosmic manifestation is created and conducted by Mah\u0101-vi\u1e63\u1e47u, Garbhodaka-\u015b\u0101y\u012b Vi\u1e63\u1e47u and K\u1e63\u012brodaka-\u015b\u0101y\u012b Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, and then again it is annihilated by Lord \u015aiva. Brahm\u0101 is a secondary creator. All these agents of creation, maintenance and annihilation are incarnations of the material qualities of the Supreme Lord. Therefore He is the beginning, the middle and the end of all creation.For advanced education there are various kinds of books of knowledge, such as the four Vedas, their six supplements, the Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra, books of logic, books of religiosity and the Pur\u0101\u1e47as. So all together there are fourteen divisions of books of education. Of these, the book which presents adhy\u0101tma-vidy\u0101, spiritual knowledge \u2013 in particular, the Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra \u2013 represents K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.Among logicians there are different kinds of argument. Supporting one\u2019s argument with evidence that also supports the opposing side is called jalpa. Merely trying to defeat one\u2019s opponent is called vita\u1e47\u1e0d\u0101. But the actual conclusion is called v\u0101da. This conclusive truth is a representation of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a."}
