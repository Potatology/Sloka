Desiring such perfection, one practices celibacy. I shall now briefly explain to you this process by which one may attain salvation.PurportLord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a has recommended to Arjuna the practice of \u1e63a\u1e6d-cakra-yoga, in which one places the air of life between the eyebrows. Taking it for granted that Arjuna might not know how to practice \u1e63a\u1e6d-cakra-yoga, the Lord explains the process in the following verses. The Lord says that Brahman, although one without a second, has various manifestations and features. Especially for the impersonalists, the ak\u1e63ara, or o\u1e41-k\u0101ra \u2013 the syllable o\u1e41 \u2013 is identical with Brahman. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a here explains the impersonal Brahman, into which the renounced order of sages enter.In the Vedic system of knowledge, students, from the very beginning, are taught to vibrate o\u1e41 and learn of the ultimate impersonal Brahman by living with the spiritual master in complete celibacy. In this way they realize two of Brahman\u2019s features. This practice is very essential for the student\u2019s advancement in spiritual life, but at the moment such brahmac\u0101r\u012b (unmarried celibate) life is not at all possible. The social construction of the world has changed so much that there is no possibility of one\u2019s practicing celibacy from the beginning of student life. Throughout the world there are many institutions for different departments of knowledge, but there is no recognized institution where students can be educated in the brahmac\u0101r\u012b principles. Unless one practices celibacy, advancement in spiritual life is very difficult. Therefore Lord Caitanya has announced, according to the scriptural injunctions for this Age of Kali, that in this age no process of realizing the Supreme is possible except the chanting of the holy names of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a: Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare."}
