Without the presence of the spirit soul, the material body cannot move. The body is only a dead vehicle to be worked by the spirit soul, which is always active and cannot stop even for a moment. As such, the spirit soul has to be engaged in the good work of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, otherwise it will be engaged in occupations dictated by the illusory energy. In contact with material energy, the spirit soul acquires material modes, and to purify the soul from such affinities it is necessary to engage in the prescribed duties enjoined in the \u015b\u0101stras. But if the soul is engaged in his natural function of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, whatever he is able to do is good for him. The \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (1.5.17) affirms this:tyaktv\u0101 sva-dharma\u1e41 cara\u1e47\u0101mbuja\u1e41 harerbhajann apakvo \u2019tha patet tato yadiyatra kva v\u0101bhadram abh\u016bd amu\u1e63ya ki\u1e41ko v\u0101rtha \u0101pto \u2019bhajat\u0101\u1e41 sva-dharmata\u1e25\u201cIf someone takes to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, even though he may not follow the prescribed duties in the \u015b\u0101stras or execute the devotional service properly, and even though he may fall down from the standard, there is no loss or evil for him. But if he carries out all the injunctions for purification in the \u015b\u0101stras, what does it avail him if he is not K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious?\u201d So the purificatory process is necessary for reaching this point of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Therefore, sanny\u0101sa, or any purificatory process, is to help reach the ultimate goal of becoming K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious, without which everything is considered a failure."}
