Otherwise, one must be engaged in sense gratification, since one cannot live without engagement. Without K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, one must be always seeking self-centered or extended selfish activities. But a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person can do everything for the satisfaction of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and thereby be perfectly detached from sense gratification. One who has no such realization must mechanically try to escape material desires before being elevated to the top rung of the yoga ladder."}
