In India the yog\u012bs \u2013 the transcendentalists or the devotees \u2013 all leave home and reside in sacred places such as Pray\u0101ga, Mathur\u0101, V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, H\u1e5b\u1e63\u012bke\u015ba and Hardwar and in solitude practice yoga where the sacred rivers like the Yamun\u0101 and the Ganges flow. But often this is not possible, especially for Westerners. The so-called yoga societies in big cities may be successful in earning material benefit, but they are not at all suitable for the actual practice of yoga. One who is not self-controlled and whose mind is not undisturbed cannot practice meditation. Therefore, in the B\u1e5bhan-n\u0101rad\u012bya Pur\u0101\u1e47a it is said that in Kali-yuga (the present yuga, or age), when people in general are short-lived, slow in spiritual realization and always disturbed by various anxieties, the best means of spiritual realization is chanting the holy name of the Lord.harer n\u0101ma harer n\u0101maharer n\u0101maiva kevalamkalau n\u0101sty eva n\u0101sty evan\u0101sty eva gatir anyath\u0101\u201cIn this age of quarrel and hypocrisy the only means of deliverance is chanting the holy name of the Lord.
