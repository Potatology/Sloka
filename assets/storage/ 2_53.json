The highest perfection of self-realization is to understand that one is eternally the servitor of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and that one\u2019s only business is to discharge one\u2019s duties in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. A K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person, or unflinching devotee of the Lord, should not be disturbed by the flowery language of the Vedas nor be engaged in fruitive activities for promotion to the heavenly kingdom. In K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, one comes directly into communion with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and thus all directions from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a may be understood in that transcendental state. One is sure to achieve results by such activities and attain conclusive knowledge. One has only to carry out the orders of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a or His representative, the spiritual master."}
