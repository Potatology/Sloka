Even if they attack, they should not be counterattacked. It is general etiquette that superiors are not to be offered even a verbal fight. Even if they are sometimes harsh in behavior, they should not be harshly treated. Then, how is it possible for Arjuna to counterattack them? Would K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a ever attack His own grandfather, Ugrasena, or His teacher, S\u0101nd\u012bpani Muni? These were some of the arguments offered by Arjuna to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a."}
