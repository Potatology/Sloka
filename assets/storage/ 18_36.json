Thus he chews the chewed. But sometimes, in the course of such enjoyment, he becomes relieved from material entanglement by association with a great soul. In other words, a conditioned soul is always engaged in some type of sense gratification, but when he understands by good association that it is only a repetition of the same thing, and he is awakened to his real K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, he is sometimes relieved from such repetitive so-called happiness."}
