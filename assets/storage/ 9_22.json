Such activities are all auspicious and full of spiritual potencies, which make the devotee perfect in self-realization, so that his only desire is to achieve the association of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Such a devotee undoubtedly approaches the Lord without difficulty. This is called yoga. By the mercy of the Lord, such a devotee never comes back to this material condition of life. K\u1e63ema refers to the merciful protection of the Lord. The Lord helps the devotee to achieve K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness by yoga, and when he becomes fully K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious the Lord protects him from falling down to a miserable conditioned life."}
