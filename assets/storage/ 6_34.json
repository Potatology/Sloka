For a man in the practical world who has to fight so many opposing elements, it is certainly very difficult to control the mind. Artificially, one may establish a mental equilibrium toward both friend and enemy, but ultimately no worldly man can do so, for this is more difficult than controlling the raging wind. In the Vedic literature (Ka\u1e6dha Upani\u1e63ad 1.3.3\u20134) it is said:\u0101tm\u0101na\u1e41 rathina\u1e41 viddhi\u015bar\u012bra\u1e41 ratham eva cabuddhi\u1e41 tu s\u0101rathi\u1e41 viddhimana\u1e25 pragraham eva caindriy\u0101\u1e47i hay\u0101n \u0101hurvi\u1e63ay\u0101\u1e41s te\u1e63u gocar\u0101n\u0101tmendriya-mano-yukta\u1e41bhoktety \u0101hur man\u012b\u1e63i\u1e47a\u1e25\u201cThe individual is the passenger in the car of the material body, and intelligence is the driver. Mind is the driving instrument, and the senses are the horses. The self is thus the enjoyer or sufferer in the association of the mind and senses. So it is understood by great thinkers.\u201d Intelligence is supposed to direct the mind, but the mind is so strong and obstinate that it often overcomes even one\u2019s own intelligence, as an acute infection may surpass the efficacy of medicine. Such a strong mind is supposed to be controlled by the practice of yoga, but such practice is never practical for a worldly person like Arjuna. And what can we say of modern man? The simile used here is appropriate: one cannot capture the blowing wind. And it is even more difficult to capture the turbulent mind. The easiest way to control the mind, as suggested by Lord Caitanya, is chanting \u201cHare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a,\u201d the great mantra for deliverance, in all humility. The method prescribed is sa vai mana\u1e25 k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-pad\u0101ravindayo\u1e25: one must engage one\u2019s mind fully in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Only then will there remain no other engagements to agitate the mind."}
