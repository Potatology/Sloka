O King, after looking at the sons of Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra drawn in military array, Arjuna then spoke to Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a these words.At that time Arjuna, the son of P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0du, seated in the chariot bearing the flag marked with Hanum\u0101n, took up his bow and prepared to shoot his arrows. O King, after looking at the sons of Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra drawn in military array, Arjuna then spoke to Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a these words.PurportThe battle was just about to begin. It is understood from the above statement that the sons of Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra were more or less disheartened by the unexpected arrangement of military force by the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas, who were guided by the direct instructions of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a on the battlefield. The emblem of Hanum\u0101n on the flag of Arjuna is another sign of victory because Hanum\u0101n cooperated with Lord R\u0101ma in the battle between R\u0101ma and R\u0101va\u1e47a, and Lord R\u0101ma emerged victorious. Now both R\u0101ma and Hanum\u0101n were present on the chariot of Arjuna to help him. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is R\u0101ma Himself, and wherever Lord R\u0101ma is, His eternal servitor Hanum\u0101n and His eternal consort S\u012bt\u0101, the goddess of fortune, are present. Therefore, Arjuna had no cause to fear any enemies whatsoever. And above all, the Lord of the senses, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, was personally present to give him direction. Thus, all good counsel was available to Arjuna in the matter of executing the battle. In such auspicious conditions, arranged by the Lord for His eternal devotee, lay the signs of assured victory."}
