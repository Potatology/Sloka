But if one is engaged in loving transcendental service to the Lord from the beginning, then one can see the Lord by revelation. Every living entity is only a spiritual spark; therefore it is not possible to see or to understand the Supreme Lord. Arjuna, as a devotee, does not depend on his speculative strength; rather, he admits his limitations as a living entity and acknowledges K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s inestimable position. Arjuna could understand that for a living entity it is not possible to understand the unlimited infinite. If the infinite reveals Himself, then it is possible to understand the nature of the infinite by the grace of the infinite. The word yoge\u015bvara is also very significant here because the Lord has inconceivable power. If He likes, He can reveal Himself by His grace, although He is unlimited. Therefore Arjuna pleads for the inconceivable grace of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. He does not give K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a orders. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is not obliged to reveal Himself unless one surrenders fully in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and engages in devotional service. Thus it is not possible for persons who depend on the strength of their mental speculations to see K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a."}
