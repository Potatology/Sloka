The person who is attached to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and works for Him only is certainly a liberated person, and he has no anxiety over the results of his work. In the Bh\u0101gavatam, the cause of anxiety over the result of an activity is explained as being one\u2019s functioning in the conception of duality, that is, without knowledge of the Absolute Truth. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Absolute Truth, the Personality of Godhead. In K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, there is no duality. All that exists is a product of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s energy, and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is all good. Therefore, activities in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness are on the absolute plane; they are transcendental and have no material effect. One is therefore filled with peace in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. But one who is entangled in profit calculation for sense gratification cannot have that peace. This is the secret of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness \u2013 realization that there is no existence besides K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the platform of peace and fearlessness."}
