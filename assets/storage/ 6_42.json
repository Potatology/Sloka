Certainly, such a birth is rare in this world.PurportBirth in a family of yog\u012bs or transcendentalists \u2013 those with great wisdom \u2013 is praised herein because the child born in such a family receives a spiritual impetus from the very beginning of his life. It is especially the case in the \u0101c\u0101rya or gosv\u0101m\u012b families. Such families are very learned and devoted by tradition and training, and thus they become spiritual masters. In India there are many such \u0101c\u0101rya families, but they have now degenerated due to insufficient education and training. By the grace of the Lord, there are still families that foster transcendentalists generation after generation. It is certainly very fortunate to take birth in such families. Fortunately, both our spiritual master, O\u1e41 Vi\u1e63\u1e47up\u0101da \u015ar\u012b \u015ar\u012bmad Bhaktisiddh\u0101nta Sarasvat\u012b Gosv\u0101m\u012b Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, and our humble self had the opportunity to take birth in such families, by the grace of the Lord, and both of us were trained in the devotional service of the Lord from the very beginning of our lives. Later on we met by the order of the transcendental system."}
