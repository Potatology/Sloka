But a self-realized yog\u012b has to control the mind; the mind should not control him. One who controls the mind (and therefore the senses as well) is called gosv\u0101m\u012b, or sv\u0101m\u012b, and one who is controlled by the mind is called go-d\u0101sa, or the servant of the senses. A gosv\u0101m\u012b knows the standard of sense happiness. In transcendental sense happiness, the senses are engaged in the service of H\u1e5b\u1e63\u012bke\u015ba, or the supreme owner of the senses \u2013 K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Serving K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a with purified senses is called K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. That is the way of bringing the senses under full control. What is more, that is the highest perfection of yoga practice."}
