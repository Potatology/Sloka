Others, curtailing the eating process, offer the outgoing breath into itself as a sacrifice.PurportThis system of yoga for controlling the breathing process is called pr\u0101\u1e47\u0101y\u0101ma, and in the beginning it is practiced in the ha\u1e6dha-yoga system through different sitting postures. All of these processes are recommended for controlling the senses and for advancement in spiritual realization. This practice involves controlling the airs within the body so as to reverse the directions of their passage. The ap\u0101na air goes downward, and the pr\u0101\u1e47a air goes up. The pr\u0101\u1e47\u0101y\u0101ma-yog\u012b practices breathing the opposite way until the currents are neutralized into p\u016braka, equilibrium. Offering the exhaled breath into the inhaled breath is called recaka. When both air currents are completely stopped, one is said to be in kumbhaka-yoga. By practice of kumbhaka-yoga, one can increase the duration of life for perfection in spiritual realization. The intelligent yog\u012b is interested in attaining perfection in one life, without waiting for the next. For by practicing kumbhaka-yoga, the yog\u012bs increase the duration of life by many, many years. A K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person, however, being always situated in the transcendental loving service of the Lord, automatically becomes the controller of the senses. His senses, being always engaged in the service of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, have no chance of becoming otherwise engaged. So at the end of life, he is naturally transferred to the transcendental plane of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a; consequently he makes no attempt to increase his longevity. He is at once raised to the platform of liberation, as stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (14.26):m\u0101\u1e41 ca yo \u2019vyabhic\u0101re\u1e47abhakti-yogena sevatesa gu\u1e47\u0101n samat\u012btyait\u0101nbrahma-bh\u016by\u0101ya kalpate\u201cOne who engages in unalloyed devotional service to the Lord transcends the modes of material nature and is immediately elevated to the spiritual platform.\u201d A K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person begins from the transcendental stage, and he is constantly in that consciousness. Therefore, there is no falling down, and ultimately he enters into the abode of the Lord without delay. The practice of reduced eating is automatically done when one eats only k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-pras\u0101dam, or food which is offered first to the Lord. Reducing the eating process is very helpful in the matter of sense control. And without sense control there is no possibility of getting out of the material entanglement."}
