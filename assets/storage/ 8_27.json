Therefore be always fixed in devotion.Although the devotees know these two paths, O Arjuna, they are never bewildered. Therefore be always fixed in devotion.PurportK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is here advising Arjuna that he should not be disturbed by the different paths the soul can take when leaving the material world. A devotee of the Supreme Lord should not worry whether he will depart by arrangement or by accident. The devotee should be firmly established in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and chant Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. He should know that concern over either of these two paths is troublesome. The best way to be absorbed in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is to be always dovetailed in His service, and this will make one\u2019s path to the spiritual kingdom safe, certain and direct. The word yoga-yukta is especially significant in this verse. One who is firm in yoga is constantly engaged in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness in all his activities. \u015ar\u012b R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b advises, an\u0101saktasya vi\u1e63ay\u0101n yath\u0101rham upayu\u00f1jata\u1e25: one should be unattached in material affairs and do everything in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. By this system, which is called yukta-vair\u0101gya, one attains perfection. Therefore the devotee is not disturbed by these descriptions, because he knows that his passage to the supreme abode is guaranteed by devotional service."}
