And are your ignorance and illusions now dispelled?PurportThe Lord was acting as the spiritual master of Arjuna. Therefore it was His duty to inquire from Arjuna whether he understood the whole Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 in its proper perspective. If not, the Lord was ready to re-explain any point, or the whole Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 if so required. Actually, anyone who hears Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 from a bona fide spiritual master like K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a or His representative will find that all his ignorance is dispelled. Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is not an ordinary book written by a poet or fiction writer; it is spoken by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Any person fortunate enough to hear these teachings from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a or from His bona fide spiritual representative is sure to become a liberated person and get out of the darkness of ignorance."}
