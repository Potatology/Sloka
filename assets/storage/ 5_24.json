He is liberated in the Supreme, and ultimately he attains the Supreme.PurportUnless one is able to relish happiness from within, how can one retire from the external engagements meant for deriving superficial happiness? A liberated person enjoys happiness by factual experience. He can, therefore, sit silently at any place and enjoy the activities of life from within. Such a liberated person no longer desires external material happiness. This state is called brahma-bh\u016bta, attaining which one is assured of going back to Godhead, back to home."}
