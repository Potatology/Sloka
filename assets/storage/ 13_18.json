He is beyond the darkness of matter and is unmanifested. He is knowledge, He is the object of knowledge, and He is the goal of knowledge. He is situated in everyone\u2019s heart.He is the source of light in all luminous objects. He is beyond the darkness of matter and is unmanifested. He is knowledge, He is the object of knowledge, and He is the goal of knowledge. He is situated in everyone\u2019s heart.PurportThe Supersoul, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is the source of light in all luminous objects like the sun, moon and stars. In the Vedic literature we find that in the spiritual kingdom there is no need of sun or moon, because the effulgence of the Supreme Lord is there. In the material world that brahma-jyotir, the Lord\u2019s spiritual effulgence, is covered by the mahat-tattva, the material elements; therefore in this material world we require the assistance of sun, moon, electricity, etc., for light. But in the spiritual world there is no need of such things. It is clearly stated in the Vedic literature that because of His luminous effulgence, everything is illuminated. It is clear, therefore, that His situation is not in the material world. He is situated in the spiritual world, which is far, far away in the spiritual sky. That is also confirmed in the Vedic literature. \u0100ditya-var\u1e47a\u1e41 tamasa\u1e25 parast\u0101t (\u015avet\u0101\u015bvatara Upani\u1e63ad 3.8). He is just like the sun, eternally luminous, but He is far, far beyond the darkness of this material world.His knowledge is transcendental. The Vedic literature confirms that Brahman is concentrated transcendental knowledge. To one who is anxious to be transferred to that spiritual world, knowledge is given by the Supreme Lord, who is situated in everyone\u2019s heart. One Vedic mantra (\u015avet\u0101\u015bvatara Upani\u1e63ad 6.18) says, ta\u1e41 ha devam \u0101tma-buddhi-prak\u0101\u015ba\u1e41 mumuk\u1e63ur vai \u015bara\u1e47am aha\u1e41 prapadye. One must surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead if he at all wants liberation. As far as the goal of ultimate knowledge is concerned, it is also confirmed in Vedic literature: tam eva viditv\u0101ti m\u1e5btyum eti. \u201cOnly by knowing Him can one surpass the boundary of birth and death.\u201d (\u015avet\u0101\u015bvatara Upani\u1e63ad 3.8)He is situated in everyone\u2019s heart as the supreme controller. The Supreme has legs and hands distributed everywhere, and this cannot be said of the individual soul. Therefore that there are two knowers of the field of activity \u2013 the individual soul and the Supersoul \u2013 must be admitted. One\u2019s hands and legs are distributed locally, but K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s hands and legs are distributed everywhere. This is confirmed in the \u015avet\u0101\u015bvatara Upani\u1e63ad (3.17): sarvasya prabhum \u012b\u015b\u0101na\u1e41 sarvasya \u015bara\u1e47a\u1e41 b\u1e5bhat. That Supreme Personality of Godhead, Supersoul, is the prabhu, or master, of all living entities; therefore He is the ultimate shelter of all living entities. So there is no denying the fact that the Supreme Supersoul and the individual soul are always different."}
