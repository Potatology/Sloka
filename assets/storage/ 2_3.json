Give up such petty weakness of heart and arise, O chastiser of the enemy.PurportArjuna was addressed as the son of P\u1e5bth\u0101, who happened to be the sister of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s father Vasudeva. Therefore Arjuna had a blood relationship with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. If the son of a k\u1e63atriya declines to fight, he is a k\u1e63atriya in name only, and if the son of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a acts impiously, he is a br\u0101hma\u1e47a in name only. Such k\u1e63atriyas and br\u0101hma\u1e47as are unworthy sons of their fathers; therefore, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a did not want Arjuna to become an unworthy son of a k\u1e63atriya. Arjuna was the most intimate friend of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was directly guiding him on the chariot; but in spite of all these credits, if Arjuna abandoned the battle he would be committing an infamous act. Therefore K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a said that such an attitude in Arjuna did not fit his personality. Arjuna might argue that he would give up the battle on the grounds of his magnanimous attitude for the most respectable Bh\u012b\u1e63ma and his relatives, but K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a considered that sort of magnanimity mere weakness of heart. Such false magnanimity was not approved by any authority. Therefore, such magnanimity or so-called nonviolence should be given up by persons like Arjuna under the direct guidance of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a."}
