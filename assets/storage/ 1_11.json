He emphasized that Bh\u012b\u1e63madeva was undoubtedly the greatest hero, but he was an old man, so everyone must especially think of his protection from all sides. He might become engaged in the fight, and the enemy might take advantage of his full engagement on one side. Therefore, it was important that other heroes not leave their strategic positions and allow the enemy to break the phalanx. Duryodhana clearly felt that the victory of the Kurus depended on the presence of Bh\u012b\u1e63madeva. He was confident of the full support of Bh\u012b\u1e63madeva and Dro\u1e47\u0101c\u0101rya in the battle because he well knew that they did not even speak a word when Arjuna\u2019s wife Draupad\u012b, in her helpless condition, had appealed to them for justice while she was being forced to appear naked in the presence of all the great generals in the assembly. Although he knew that the two generals had some sort of affection for the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas, he hoped that these generals would now completely give it up, as they had done during the gambling performances."}
