The living entities are part and parcel of Him, and therefore the senses of the living entities are also part and parcel of His senses. The impersonalists cannot account for the senses of the living entities, and therefore they are always anxious to describe all living entities as senseless, or impersonal. The Lord, situated in the hearts of all living entities, directs their senses. But He directs in terms of the surrender of the living entity, and in the case of a pure devotee He directly controls the senses. Here on the Battlefield of Kuruk\u1e63etra the Lord directly controls the transcendental senses of Arjuna, and thus His particular name of H\u1e5b\u1e63\u012bke\u015ba. The Lord has different names according to His different activities. For example, His name is Madhus\u016bdana because He killed the demon of the name Madhu; His name is Govinda because He gives pleasure to the cows and to the senses; His name is V\u0101sudeva because He appeared as the son of Vasudeva; His name is Devak\u012b-nandana because He accepted Devak\u012b as His mother; His name is Ya\u015bod\u0101-nandana because He awarded His childhood pastimes to Ya\u015bod\u0101 at V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana; His name is P\u0101rtha-s\u0101rathi because He worked as charioteer of His friend Arjuna. Similarly, His name is H\u1e5b\u1e63\u012bke\u015ba because He gave direction to Arjuna on the Battlefield of Kuruk\u1e63etra.Arjuna is referred to as Dhana\u00f1jaya in this verse because he helped his elder brother in fetching wealth when it was required by the king to make expenditures for different sacrifices. Similarly, Bh\u012bma is known as V\u1e5bkodara because he could eat as voraciously as he could perform herculean tasks, such as killing the demon Hi\u1e0dimba. So the particular types of conchshell blown by the different personalities on the side of the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas, beginning with the Lord\u2019s, were all very encouraging to the fighting soldiers. On the other side there were no such credits, nor the presence of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the supreme director, nor that of the goddess of fortune. So they were predestined to lose the battle \u2013 and that was the message announced by the sounds of the conchshells."}
