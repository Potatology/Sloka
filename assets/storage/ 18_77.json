It is, of course, said that Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a had never exhibited such a form before. It was exhibited to Arjuna only, yet some great devotees could also see the universal form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a when it was shown to Arjuna, and Vy\u0101sa was one of them. He is one of the great devotees of the Lord, and he is considered to be a powerful incarnation of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Vy\u0101sa disclosed this to his disciple Sa\u00f1jaya, who remembered that wonderful form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a exhibited to Arjuna and enjoyed it repeatedly."}
