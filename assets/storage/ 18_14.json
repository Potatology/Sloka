The soul within the body is acting to bring about the results of activity and is therefore known as kart\u0101, \u201cthe doer.\u201d That the soul is the knower and the doer is stated in the \u015bruti. E\u1e63a hi dra\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101 sra\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101 (Pra\u015bna Upani\u1e63ad 4.9). It is also confirmed in the Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra by the verses j\u00f1o \u2019ta eva (2.3.18) and kart\u0101 \u015b\u0101str\u0101rthavattv\u0101t (2.3.33). The instruments of action are the senses, and by the senses the soul acts in various ways. For each and every action there is a different endeavor. But all one\u2019s activities depend on the will of the Supersoul, who is seated within the heart as a friend. The Supreme Lord is the supercause. Under these circumstances, he who is acting in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness under the direction of the Supersoul situated within the heart is naturally not bound by any activity. Those in complete K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness are not ultimately responsible for their actions. Everything is dependent on the supreme will, the Supersoul, the Supreme Personality of Godhead."}
