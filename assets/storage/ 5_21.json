The highest pleasure in terms of matter is sex pleasure. The whole world is moving under its spell, and a materialist cannot work at all without this motivation. But a person engaged in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness can work with greater vigor without sex pleasure, which he avoids. That is the test in spiritual realization. Spiritual realization and sex pleasure go ill together. A K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person is not attracted to any kind of sense pleasure, due to his being a liberated soul."}
