Some of them are full of polluted material things within their hearts, and some of them are materially free. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is equally beneficial for both of these persons. Those who are full of dirty things can take to the line of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness for a gradual cleansing process, following the regulative principles of devotional service. Those who are already cleansed of the impurities may continue to act in the same K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness so that others may follow their exemplary activities and thereby be benefited. Foolish persons or neophytes in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness often want to retire from activities without having knowledge of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Arjuna\u2019s desire to retire from activities on the battlefield was not approved by the Lord. One need only know how to act. To retire from the activities of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and to sit aloof making a show of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is less important than actually engaging in the field of activities for the sake of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Arjuna is here advised to act in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, following in the footsteps of the Lord\u2019s previous disciples, such as the sun-god Vivasv\u0101n, as mentioned hereinbefore. The Supreme Lord knows all His past activities, as well as those of persons who acted in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness in the past. Therefore He recommends the acts of the sun-god, who learned this art from the Lord some millions of years before. All such students of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a are mentioned here as past liberated persons, engaged in the discharge of duties allotted by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a."}
