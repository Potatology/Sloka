And so wonderful is that message that my hair is standing on end.PurportIn the beginning of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra inquired from his secretary Sa\u00f1jaya, \u201cWhat happened on the Battlefield of Kuruk\u1e63etra?\u201d The entire study was related to the heart of Sa\u00f1jaya by the grace of his spiritual master, Vy\u0101sa. He thus explained the theme of the battlefield. The conversation was wonderful because such an important conversation between two great souls had never taken place before and would not take place again. It was wonderful because the Supreme Personality of Godhead was speaking about Himself and His energies to the living entity, Arjuna, a great devotee of the Lord. If we follow in the footsteps of Arjuna to understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, then our life will be happy and successful. Sa\u00f1jaya realized this, and as he began to understand it, he related the conversation to Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra. Now it is concluded that wherever there is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and Arjuna, there is victory."}
