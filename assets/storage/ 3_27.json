The person in material consciousness is convinced by false ego that he is the doer of everything. He does not know that the mechanism of the body is produced by material nature, which works under the supervision of the Supreme Lord. The materialistic person has no knowledge that ultimately he is under the control of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The person in false ego takes all credit for doing everything independently, and that is the symptom of his nescience. He does not know that this gross and subtle body is the creation of material nature, under the order of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and as such his bodily and mental activities should be engaged in the service of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. The ignorant man forgets that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is known as H\u1e5b\u1e63\u012bke\u015ba, or the master of the senses of the material body, for due to his long misuse of the senses in sense gratification, he is factually bewildered by the false ego, which makes him forget his eternal relationship with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a."}
