Although the person in full K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness may apparently be on the sensual plane, because of his being K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious he has no attachment to sensual activities. The K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person is concerned only with the satisfaction of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and nothing else. Therefore he is transcendental to all attachment and detachment. If K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a wants, the devotee can do anything which is ordinarily undesirable; and if K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a does not want, he shall not do that which he would have ordinarily done for his own satisfaction. Therefore to act or not to act is within his control because he acts only under the direction of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. This consciousness is the causeless mercy of the Lord, which the devotee can achieve in spite of his being attached to the sensual platform."}
