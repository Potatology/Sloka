And the path of realization has been recommended: buddhi-yoga, or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Sometimes K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is misunderstood to be inertia, and one with such a misunderstanding often withdraws to a secluded place to become fully K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious by chanting the holy name of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. But without being trained in the philosophy of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, it is not advisable to chant the holy name of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in a secluded place, where one may acquire only cheap adoration from the innocent public. Arjuna also thought of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness or buddhi-yoga, or intelligence in spiritual advancement of knowledge, as something like retirement from active life and the practice of penance and austerity at a secluded place. In other words, he wanted to skillfully avoid the fighting by using K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness as an excuse. But as a sincere student, he placed the matter before his master and questioned K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as to his best course of action. In answer, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a elaborately explained karma-yoga, or work in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, in this Third Chapter."}
