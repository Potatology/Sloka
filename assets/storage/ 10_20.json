I am the beginning, the middle and the end of all beings.I am the Supersoul, O Arjuna, seated in the hearts of all living entities. I am the beginning, the middle and the end of all beings.PurportIn this verse Arjuna is addressed as Gu\u1e0d\u0101ke\u015ba, which means \u201cone who has conquered the darkness of sleep.\u201d For those who are sleeping in the darkness of ignorance, it is not possible to understand how the Supreme Personality of Godhead manifests Himself in various ways in the material and spiritual worlds. Thus this address by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to Arjuna is significant. Because Arjuna is above such darkness, the Personality of Godhead agrees to describe His various opulences.K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a first informs Arjuna that He is the soul of the entire cosmic manifestation by dint of His primary expansion. Before the material creation, the Supreme Lord, by His plenary expansion, accepts the puru\u1e63a incarnation, and from Him everything begins. Therefore He is \u0101tm\u0101, the soul of the mahat-tattva, the universal elements. The total material energy is not the cause of the creation; actually the Mah\u0101-vi\u1e63\u1e47u enters into the mahat-tattva, the total material energy. He is the soul. When Mah\u0101-vi\u1e63\u1e47u enters into the manifested universes, He again manifests Himself as the Supersoul in each and every entity. We have experience that the personal body of the living entity exists due to the presence of the spiritual spark. Without the existence of the spiritual spark, the body cannot develop. Similarly, the material manifestation cannot develop unless the Supreme Soul, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, enters. As stated in the Sub\u0101la Upani\u1e63ad, prak\u1e5bty-\u0101di-sarva-bh\u016bt\u0101ntar-y\u0101m\u012b sarva-\u015be\u1e63\u012b ca n\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a\u1e25: \u201cThe Supreme Personality of Godhead is existing as the Supersoul in all manifested universes.\u201dThe three puru\u1e63a-avat\u0101ras are described in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam. They are also described in the N\u0101rada Pa\u00f1car\u0101tra, one of the S\u0101tvata-tantras.

Therefore the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the beginning of this universe, the maintainer of the universal manifestations, and the end of all energy."}
