That Supreme Personality of Godhead is also, by His plenary portions, alive in the heart of every living entity. Only saintly persons who can see, within and without, the same Supreme Lord can actually attain to perfect and eternal peace.nityo nity\u0101n\u0101\u1e41 cetana\u015b cetan\u0101n\u0101meko bah\u016bn\u0101\u1e41 yo vidadh\u0101ti k\u0101m\u0101ntam \u0101tma-stha\u1e41 ye \u2019nupa\u015byanti dh\u012br\u0101ste\u1e63\u0101\u1e41 \u015b\u0101nti\u1e25 \u015b\u0101\u015bvat\u012b netare\u1e63\u0101m(Ka\u1e6dha Upani\u1e63ad 2.2.13)The same Vedic truth given to Arjuna is given to all persons in the world who pose themselves as very learned but factually have but a poor fund of knowledge. The Lord says clearly that He Himself, Arjuna and all the kings who are assembled on the battlefield are eternally individual beings and that the Lord is eternally the maintainer of the individual living entities both in their conditioned and in their liberated situations. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is the supreme individual person, and Arjuna, the Lord\u2019s eternal associate, and all the kings assembled there are individual eternal persons. It is not that they did not exist as individuals in the past, and it is not that they will not remain eternal persons. Their individuality existed in the past, and their individuality will continue in the future without interruption. Therefore, there is no cause for lamentation for anyone.The M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b theory that after liberation the individual soul, separated by the covering of m\u0101y\u0101, or illusion, will merge into the impersonal Brahman and lose its individual existence is not supported herein by Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the supreme authority. Nor is the theory that we only think of individuality in the conditioned state supported herein. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a clearly says herein that in the future also the individuality of the Lord and others, as it is confirmed in the Upani\u1e63ads, will continue eternally. This statement of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s is authoritative because K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a cannot be subject to illusion. If individuality were not a fact, then K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a would not have stressed it so much \u2013 even for the future. The M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b may argue that the individuality spoken of by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is not spiritual, but material. Even accepting the argument that the individuality is material, then how can one distinguish K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s individuality? K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a affirms His individuality in the past and confirms His individuality in the future also. He has confirmed His individuality in many ways, and impersonal Brahman has been declared to be subordinate to Him. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a has maintained spiritual individuality all along; if He is accepted as an ordinary conditioned soul in individual consciousness, then His Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 has no value as authoritative scripture. A common man with all the four defects of human frailty is unable to teach that which is worth hearing. The G\u012bt\u0101 is above such literature. No mundane book compares with the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. When one accepts K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as an ordinary man, the G\u012bt\u0101 loses all importance. The M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b argues that the plurality mentioned in this verse is conventional and that it refers to the body. But previous to this verse such a bodily conception is already condemned. After condemning the bodily conception of the living entities, how was it possible for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to place a conventional proposition on the body again? Therefore, individuality is maintained on spiritual grounds and is thus confirmed by great \u0101c\u0101ryas like \u015ar\u012b R\u0101m\u0101nuja and others. It is clearly mentioned in many places in the G\u012bt\u0101 that this spiritual individuality is understood by those who are devotees of the Lord. Those who are envious of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as the Supreme Personality of Godhead have no bona fide access to the great literature. The nondevotee\u2019s approach to the teachings of the G\u012bt\u0101 is something like that of a bee licking on a bottle of honey. One cannot have a taste of honey unless one opens the bottle. Similarly, the mysticism of the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 can be understood only by devotees, and no one else can taste it, as it is stated in the Fourth Chapter of the book. Nor can the G\u012bt\u0101 be touched by persons who envy the very existence of the Lord. Therefore, the M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b explanation of the G\u012bt\u0101 is a most misleading presentation of the whole truth. Lord Caitanya has forbidden us to read commentations made by the M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012bs and warns that one who takes to such an understanding of the M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b philosophy loses all power to understand the real mystery of the G\u012bt\u0101. If individuality refers to the empirical universe, then there is no need of teaching by the Lord. The plurality of the individual soul and the Lord is an eternal fact, and it is confirmed by the Vedas as above mentioned."}
