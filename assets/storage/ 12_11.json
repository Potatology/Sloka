If one attaches himself directly to the activities of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, there may be objections from family members, or so many other difficulties. For one who has such a problem, it is advised that he sacrifice the accumulated result of his activities to some good cause. Such procedures are described in the Vedic rules. There are many descriptions of sacrifices and special functions for the full-moon day, and there is special work in which the result of one\u2019s previous action may be applied. Thus one may gradually become elevated to the state of knowledge. It is also found that when one who is not even interested in the activities of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness gives charity to some hospital or some other social institution, he gives up the hard-earned results of his activities. That is also recommended here because by the practice of giving up the fruits of one\u2019s activities one is sure to purify his mind gradually, and in that purified stage of mind one becomes able to understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Of course, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is not dependent on any other experience, because K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness itself can purify one\u2019s mind, but if there are impediments to accepting K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, one may try to give up the results of his actions. In that respect, social service, community service, national service, sacrifice for one\u2019s country, etc., may be accepted so that some day one may come to the stage of pure devotional service to the Supreme Lord. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (18.46) we find it is stated, yata\u1e25 prav\u1e5bttir bh\u016bt\u0101n\u0101m: if one decides to sacrifice for the supreme cause, even if he does not know that the supreme cause is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, he will come gradually to understand that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the supreme cause by the sacrificial method."}
