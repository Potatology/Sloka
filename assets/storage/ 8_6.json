A person who at the end of his life quits his body thinking of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a attains the transcendental nature of the Supreme Lord, but it is not true that a person who thinks of something other than K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a attains the same transcendental state. This is a point we should note very carefully. How can one die in the proper state of mind? Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Bharata, although a great personality, thought of a deer at the end of his life, and so in his next life he was transferred into the body of a deer. Although as a deer he remembered his past activities, he had to accept that animal body. Of course, one\u2019s thoughts during the course of one\u2019s life accumulate to influence one\u2019s thoughts at the moment of death, so this life creates one\u2019s next life. If in one\u2019s present life one lives in the mode of goodness and always thinks of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, it is possible for one to remember K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a at the end of one\u2019s life. That will help one be transferred to the transcendental nature of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. If one is transcendentally absorbed in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s service, then his next body will be transcendental (spiritual), not material. Therefore the chanting of Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare is the best process for successfully changing one\u2019s state of being at the end of one\u2019s life."}
