who treats alike both friend and enemy; and who has renounced all material activities \u2013 such a person is said to have transcended the modes of nature.PurportArjuna submitted three different questions, and the Lord answers them one after another. In these verses, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a first indicates that a person transcendentally situated has no envy and does not hanker for anything. When a living entity stays in this material world embodied by the material body, it is to be understood that he is under the control of one of the three modes of material nature. When he is actually out of the body, then he is out of the clutches of the material modes of nature. But as long as he is not out of the material body, he should be neutral. He should engage himself in the devotional service of the Lord so that his identity with the material body will automatically be forgotten. When one is conscious of the material body, he acts only for sense gratification, but when one transfers the consciousness to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, sense gratification automatically stops. One does not need this material body, and he does not need to accept the dictations of the material body. The qualities of the material modes in the body will act, but as spirit soul the self is aloof from such activities. How does he become aloof? He does not desire to enjoy the body, nor does he desire to get out of it. Thus transcendentally situated, the devotee becomes automatically free. He need not try to become free from the influence of the modes of material nature.The next question concerns the dealings of a transcendentally situated person. The materially situated person is affected by so-called honor and dishonor offered to the body, but the transcendentally situated person is not affected by such false honor and dishonor. He performs his duty in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and does not mind whether a man honors or dishonors him. He accepts things that are favorable for his duty in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, otherwise he has no necessity of anything material, either a stone or gold. He takes everyone as his dear friend who helps him in his execution of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, and he does not hate his so-called enemy. He is equally disposed and sees everything on an equal level because he knows perfectly well that he has nothing to do with material existence. Social and political issues do not affect him, because he knows the situation of temporary upheavals and disturbances. He does not attempt anything for his own sake. He can attempt anything for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, but for his personal self he does not attempt anything. By such behavior one becomes actually transcendentally situated."}
