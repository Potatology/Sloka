In the material existence of life, one is certainly influenced by propensities for lust and desire for dominating the resources of material nature. Desire for overlording and for sense gratification is the greatest enemy of the conditioned soul; but by the strength of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, one can control the material senses, the mind and the intelligence. One may not give up work and prescribed duties all of a sudden; but by gradually developing K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, one can be situated in a transcendental position without being influenced by the material senses and the mind \u2013 by steady intelligence directed toward one\u2019s pure identity. This is the sum total of this chapter. In the immature stage of material existence, philosophical speculations and artificial attempts to control the senses by the so-called practice of yogic postures can never help a man toward spiritual life. He must be trained in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness by higher intelligence.Thus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Third Chapter of the \u015ar\u012bmad Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 in the matter of Karma-yoga, or the Discharge of One\u2019s Prescribed Duty in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Consciousness."}
