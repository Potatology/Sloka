Irresponsible work is destructive because it destroys the regulative principles of scriptural injunction. It is often based on violence and is distressing to other living entities. Such irresponsible work is carried out in the light of one\u2019s personal experience. This is called illusion. And all such illusory work is a product of the mode of ignorance."}
