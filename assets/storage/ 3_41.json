J\u00f1\u0101na refers to knowledge of self as distinguished from non-self, or in other words, knowledge that the spirit soul is not the body. Vij\u00f1\u0101na refers to specific knowledge of the spirit soul\u2019s constitutional position and his relationship to the Supreme Soul. It is explained thus in the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (2.9.31):j\u00f1\u0101na\u1e41 parama-guhya\u1e41 meyad vij\u00f1\u0101na-samanvitamsa-rahasya\u1e41 tad-a\u1e45ga\u1e41 cag\u1e5bh\u0101\u1e47a gadita\u1e41 may\u0101\u201cThe knowledge of the self and Supreme Self is very confidential and mysterious, but such knowledge and specific realization can be understood if explained with their various aspects by the Lord Himself.\u201d Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 gives us that general and specific knowledge of the self. The living entities are parts and parcels of the Lord, and therefore they are simply meant to serve the Lord. This consciousness is called K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. So, from the very beginning of life one has to learn this K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, and thereby one may become fully K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious and act accordingly.Lust is only the perverted reflection of the love of God which is natural for every living entity. But if one is educated in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness from the very beginning, that natural love of God cannot deteriorate into lust. When love of God deteriorates into lust, it is very difficult to return to the normal condition. Nonetheless, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is so powerful that even a late beginner can become a lover of God by following the regulative principles of devotional service. So, from any stage of life, or from the time of understanding its urgency, one can begin regulating the senses in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, devotional service of the Lord, and turn the lust into love of Godhead \u2013 the highest perfectional stage of human life."}
