I long to see You in that form.O universal form, O thousand-armed Lord, I wish to see You in Your four-armed form, with helmeted head and with club, wheel, conch and lotus flower in Your hands. I long to see You in that form.PurportIn the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 (5.39) it is stated, r\u0101m\u0101di-m\u016brti\u1e63u kal\u0101-niyamena ti\u1e63\u1e6dhan: the Lord is eternally situated in hundreds and thousands of forms, and the main forms are those like R\u0101ma, N\u1e5bsi\u1e41ha, N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, etc. There are innumerable forms. But Arjuna knew that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the original Personality of Godhead assuming His temporary universal form. He is now asking to see the form of N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, a spiritual form. This verse establishes without any doubt the statement of the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the original Personality of Godhead and all other features originate from Him. He is not different from His plenary expansions, and He is God in any of His innumerable forms. In all of these forms He is fresh like a young man. That is the constant feature of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One who knows K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a becomes free at once from all contamination of the material world."}
