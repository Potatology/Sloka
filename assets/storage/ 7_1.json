K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is full in all opulences, and how He manifests such opulences is described herein. Also, four kinds of fortunate people who become attached to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and four kinds of unfortunate people who never take to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a are described in this chapter.In the first six chapters of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, the living entity has been described as nonmaterial spirit soul capable of elevating himself to self-realization by different types of yogas. At the end of the Sixth Chapter, it has been clearly stated that the steady concentration of the mind upon K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, or in other words K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, is the highest form of all yoga. By concentrating one\u2019s mind upon K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, one is able to know the Absolute Truth completely, but not otherwise. Impersonal brahma-jyotir or localized Param\u0101tm\u0101 realization is not perfect knowledge of the Absolute Truth, because it is partial. Full and scientific knowledge is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and everything is revealed to the person in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. In complete K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness one knows that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is ultimate knowledge beyond any doubts. Different types of yoga are only steppingstones on the path of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. One who takes directly to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness automatically knows about brahma-jyotir and Param\u0101tm\u0101 in full. By practice of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness yoga, one can know everything in full \u2013 namely the Absolute Truth, the living entities, the material nature, and their manifestations with paraphernalia.One should therefore begin yoga practice as directed in the last verse of the Sixth Chapter. Concentration of the mind upon K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a the Supreme is made possible by prescribed devotional service in nine different forms, of which \u015brava\u1e47am is the first and most important. The Lord therefore says to Arjuna, tac ch\u1e5b\u1e47u, or \u201cHear from Me.\u201d No one can be a greater authority than K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and therefore by hearing from Him one receives the greatest opportunity to become a perfectly K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person. One has therefore to learn from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a directly or from a pure devotee of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a \u2013 and not from a nondevotee upstart, puffed up with academic education.In the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam this process of understanding K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Absolute Truth, is described in the Second Chapter of the First Canto as follows:\u015b\u1e5b\u1e47vat\u0101\u1e41 sva-kath\u0101\u1e25 k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u1e25pu\u1e47ya-\u015brava\u1e47a-k\u012brtana\u1e25h\u1e5bdy anta\u1e25-stho hy abhadr\u0101\u1e47ividhunoti suh\u1e5bt sat\u0101mna\u1e63\u1e6da-pr\u0101ye\u1e63v abhadre\u1e63unitya\u1e41 bh\u0101gavata-sevay\u0101bhagavaty uttama-\u015blokebhaktir bhavati nai\u1e63\u1e6dhik\u012btad\u0101 rajas-tamo-bh\u0101v\u0101\u1e25k\u0101ma-lobh\u0101daya\u015b ca yeceta etair an\u0101viddha\u1e41sthita\u1e41 sattve pras\u012bdatieva\u1e41 prasanna-manasobhagavad-bhakti-yogata\u1e25bhagavat-tattva-vij\u00f1\u0101na\u1e41mukta-sa\u1e45gasya j\u0101yatebhidyate h\u1e5bdaya-granthi\u015bchidyante sarva-sa\u1e41\u015bay\u0101\u1e25k\u1e63\u012byante c\u0101sya karm\u0101\u1e47id\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6da ev\u0101tman\u012b\u015bvare\u201cTo hear about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a from Vedic literatures, or to hear from Him directly through the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, is itself righteous activity. And for one who hears about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who is dwelling in everyone\u2019s heart, acts as a best-wishing friend and purifies the devotee who constantly engages in hearing of Him. In this way, a devotee naturally develops his dormant transcendental knowledge. As he hears more about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a from the Bh\u0101gavatam and from the devotees, he becomes fixed in the devotional service of the Lord. By development of devotional service one becomes freed from the modes of passion and ignorance, and thus material lusts and avarice are diminished. When these impurities are wiped away, the candidate remains steady in his position of pure goodness, becomes enlivened by devotional service and understands the science of God perfectly. Thus bhakti-yoga severs the hard knot of material affection and enables one to come at once to the stage of asa\u1e41\u015baya\u1e41 samagram, understanding of the Supreme Absolute Truth Personality of Godhead.\u201d (Bh\u0101g. 1.2.17\u201321) Therefore only by hearing from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a or from His devotee in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness can one understand the science of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a."}
