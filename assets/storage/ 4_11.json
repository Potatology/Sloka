Everyone follows My path in all respects, O son of P\u1e5bth\u0101.PurportEveryone is searching for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in the different aspects of His manifestations. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is partially realized in His impersonal brahma-jyotir effulgence and as the all-pervading Supersoul dwelling within everything, including the particles of atoms. But K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is fully realized only by His pure devotees. Consequently, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the object of everyone\u2019s realization, and thus anyone and everyone is satisfied according to one\u2019s desire to have Him. In the transcendental world also, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a reciprocates with His pure devotees in the transcendental attitude, just as the devotee wants Him. One devotee may want K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as supreme master, another as his personal friend, another as his son and still another as his lover. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a rewards all the devotees equally, according to their different intensities of love for Him. In the material world, the same reciprocations of feelings are there, and they are equally exchanged by the Lord with the different types of worshipers. The pure devotees both here and in the transcendental abode associate with Him in person and are able to render personal service to the Lord and thus derive transcendental bliss in His loving service. As for those who are impersonalists and who want to commit spiritual suicide by annihilating the individual existence of the living entity, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a helps also by absorbing them into His effulgence. Such impersonalists do not agree to accept the eternal, blissful Personality of Godhead; consequently they cannot relish the bliss of transcendental personal service to the Lord, having extinguished their individuality. Some of them, who are not firmly situated even in the impersonal existence, return to this material field to exhibit their dormant desires for activities. They are not admitted into the spiritual planets, but they are again given a chance to act on the material planets. For those who are fruitive workers, the Lord awards the desired results of their prescribed duties, as the yaj\u00f1e\u015bvara; and those who are yog\u012bs seeking mystic powers are awarded such powers. In other words, everyone is dependent for success upon His mercy alone, and all kinds of spiritual processes are but different degrees of success on the same path. Unless, therefore, one comes to the highest perfection of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, all attempts remain imperfect, as is stated in the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (2.3.10):ak\u0101ma\u1e25 sarva-k\u0101mo v\u0101mok\u1e63a-k\u0101ma ud\u0101ra-dh\u012b\u1e25t\u012bvre\u1e47a bhakti-yogenayajeta puru\u1e63a\u1e41 param\u201cWhether one is without desire [the condition of the devotees], or is desirous of all fruitive results or is after liberation, one should with all efforts try to worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead for complete perfection, culminating in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.\u201d"}
