During the daytime of Brahm\u0101 they can exhibit their activities on higher and lower planets within this material world, but at the coming of Brahm\u0101\u2019s night they are all annihilated. In the day they receive various bodies for material activities, and at night they no longer have bodies but remain compact in the body of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. Then again they are manifest at the arrival of Brahm\u0101\u2019s day. Bh\u016btv\u0101 bh\u016btv\u0101 pral\u012byate: during the day they become manifest, and at night they are annihilated again. Ultimately, when Brahm\u0101\u2019s life is finished, they are all annihilated and remain unmanifest for millions and millions of years. And when Brahm\u0101 is born again in another millennium they are again manifest. In this way they are captivated by the spell of the material world. But those intelligent persons who take to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness use the human life fully in the devotional service of the Lord, chanting Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare. Thus they transfer themselves, even in this life, to the spiritual planet of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and become eternally blissful there, not being subject to such rebirths."}
