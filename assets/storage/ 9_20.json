Purified of sinful reactions, they take birth on the pious, heavenly planet of Indra, where they enjoy godly delights.PurportThe word trai-vidy\u0101\u1e25 refers to the three Vedas \u2013 S\u0101ma, Yajur and \u1e5ag. A br\u0101hma\u1e47a who has studied these three Vedas is called a tri-ved\u012b. Anyone who is very much attached to knowledge derived from these three Vedas is respected in society. Unfortunately, there are many great scholars of the Vedas who do not know the ultimate purport of studying them. Therefore K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a herein declares Himself to be the ultimate goal for the tri-ved\u012bs. Actual tri-ved\u012bs take shelter under the lotus feet of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and engage in pure devotional service to satisfy the Lord. Devotional service begins with the chanting of the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mantra and side by side trying to understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in truth. Unfortunately those who are simply official students of the Vedas become more interested in offering sacrifices to the different demigods like Indra and Candra. By such endeavor, the worshipers of different demigods are certainly purified of the contamination of the lower qualities of nature and are thereby elevated to the higher planetary systems or heavenly planets known as Maharloka, Janaloka, Tapoloka, etc. Once situated on those higher planetary systems, one can satisfy his senses hundreds of thousands of times better than on this planet."}
