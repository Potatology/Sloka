Therefore, having come to this temporary, miserable world, engage in loving service unto Me.PurportIn this material world there are classifications of people, but, after all, this world is not a happy place for anyone. It is clearly stated here, anityam asukha\u1e41 lokam: this world is temporary and full of miseries, not habitable for any sane gentleman. This world is declared by the Supreme Personality of Godhead to be temporary and full of miseries. Some philosophers, especially M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b philosophers, say that this world is false, but we can understand from Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 that the world is not false; it is temporary. There is a difference between temporary and false. This world is temporary, but there is another world, which is eternal. This world is miserable, but the other world is eternal and blissful.Arjuna was born in a saintly royal family. To him also the Lord says, \u201cTake to My devotional service and come quickly back to Godhead, back home.\u201d No one should remain in this temporary world, full as it is with miseries. Everyone should attach himself to the bosom of the Supreme Personality of Godhead so that he can be eternally happy. The devotional service of the Supreme Lord is the only process by which all problems of all classes of men can be solved. Everyone should therefore take to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and make his life perfect."}
