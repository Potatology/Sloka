Arjuna, after hearing the essential four verses of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 in this chapter, became completely free from all doubts and accepted K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He at once boldly declares, \u201cYou are para\u1e41 brahma, the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\u201d And previously K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a stated that He is the originator of everything and everyone. Every demigod and every human being is dependent on Him. Men and demigods, out of ignorance, think that they are absolute and independent of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. That ignorance is removed perfectly by the discharge of devotional service. This has already been explained in the previous verse by the Lord. Now, by His grace, Arjuna is accepting Him as the Supreme Truth, in concordance with the Vedic injunction. It is not that because K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is Arjuna\u2019s intimate friend Arjuna is flattering Him by calling Him the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Absolute Truth. Whatever Arjuna says in these two verses is confirmed by Vedic truth. Vedic injunctions affirm that only one who takes to devotional service to the Supreme Lord can understand Him, whereas others cannot. Each and every word of this verse spoken by Arjuna is confirmed by Vedic injunction.In the Kena Upani\u1e63ad it is stated that the Supreme Brahman is the rest for everything, and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a has already explained that everything is resting on Him. The Mu\u1e47\u1e0daka Upani\u1e63ad confirms that the Supreme Lord, in whom everything is resting, can be realized only by those who engage constantly in thinking of Him. This constant thinking of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is smara\u1e47am, one of the methods of devotional service. It is only by devotional service to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a that one can understand his position and get rid of this material body.In the Vedas the Supreme Lord is accepted as the purest of the pure. One who understands that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the purest of the pure can become purified from all sinful activities. One cannot be disinfected from sinful activities unless he surrenders unto the Supreme Lord. Arjuna\u2019s acceptance of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as the supreme pure complies with the injunctions of Vedic literature. This is also confirmed by great personalities, of whom N\u0101rada is the chief.K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and one should always meditate upon Him and enjoy one\u2019s transcendental relationship with Him. He is the supreme existence. He is free from bodily needs, birth and death. Not only does Arjuna confirm this, but all the Vedic literatures, the Pur\u0101\u1e47as and histories. In all Vedic literatures K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is thus described, and the Supreme Lord Himself also says in the Fourth Chapter, \u201cAlthough I am unborn, I appear on this earth to establish religious principles.\u201d He is the supreme origin; He has no cause, for He is the cause of all causes, and everything is emanating from Him. This perfect knowledge can be had by the grace of the Supreme Lord.Here Arjuna expresses himself through the grace of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. If we want to understand Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, we should accept the statements in these two verses. This is called the parampar\u0101 system, acceptance of the disciplic succession. Unless one is in the disciplic succession, he cannot understand Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. It is not possible by so-called academic education. Unfortunately those proud of their academic education, despite so much evidence in Vedic literatures, stick to their obstinate conviction that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is an ordinary person."}
