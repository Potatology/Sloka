Indeed, the self-realized person sees Me, the same Supreme Lord, everywhere.A true yog\u012b observes Me in all beings and also sees every being in Me. Indeed, the self-realized person sees Me, the same Supreme Lord, everywhere.PurportA K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious yog\u012b is the perfect seer because he sees K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme, situated in everyone\u2019s heart as Supersoul (Param\u0101tm\u0101). \u012a\u015bvara\u1e25 sarva-bh\u016bt\u0101n\u0101\u1e41 h\u1e5bd-de\u015be \u2019rjuna ti\u1e63\u1e6dhati. The Lord in His Param\u0101tm\u0101 feature is situated within both the heart of the dog and that of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a. The perfect yog\u012b knows that the Lord is eternally transcendental and is not materially affected by His presence in either a dog or a br\u0101hma\u1e47a. That is the supreme neutrality of the Lord. The individual soul is also situated in the individual heart, but he is not present in all hearts. That is the distinction between the individual soul and the Supersoul. One who is not factually in the practice of yoga cannot see so clearly. A K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person can see K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in the heart of both the believer and the nonbeliever. In the sm\u1e5bti this is confirmed as follows: \u0101tatatv\u0101c ca m\u0101t\u1e5btv\u0101c ca \u0101tm\u0101 hi paramo hari\u1e25. The Lord, being the source of all beings, is like the mother and the maintainer. As the mother is neutral to all different kinds of children, the supreme father (or mother) is also. Consequently the Supersoul is always in every living being.Outwardly, also, every living being is situated in the energy of the Lord. As will be explained in the Seventh Chapter, the Lord has, primarily, two energies \u2013 the spiritual (or superior) and the material (or inferior). The living entity, although part of the superior energy, is conditioned by the inferior energy; the living entity is always in the Lord\u2019s energy. Every living entity is situated in Him in one way or another.The yog\u012b sees equally because he sees that all living entities, although in different situations according to the results of fruitive work, in all circumstances remain the servants of God. While in the material energy, the living entity serves the material senses; and while in the spiritual energy, he serves the Supreme Lord directly. In either case the living entity is the servant of God. This vision of equality is perfect in a person in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness."}
