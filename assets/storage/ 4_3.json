The Lord selected Arjuna as the recipient of this great science owing to his being a devotee of the Lord, but for the demon it is not possible to understand this great mysterious science. There are a number of editions of this great book of knowledge. Some of them have commentaries by the devotees, and some of them have commentaries by the demons. Commentation by the devotees is real, whereas that of the demons is useless. Arjuna accepts \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and any commentary on the G\u012bt\u0101 following in the footsteps of Arjuna is real devotional service to the cause of this great science. The demonic, however, do not accept Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as He is. Instead they concoct something about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and mislead general readers from the path of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s instructions. Here is a warning about such misleading paths. One should try to follow the disciplic succession from Arjuna, and thus be benefited by this great science of \u015ar\u012bmad Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101."}
