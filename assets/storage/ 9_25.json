These are vividly described in the fruitive activities portion of the Vedas, which recommends a specific worship of demigods situated on different heavenly planets. Similarly, one can attain the Pit\u0101 planets by performing a specific yaj\u00f1a. Similarly, one can go to many ghostly planets and become a Yak\u1e63a, Rak\u1e63a or Pi\u015b\u0101ca. Pi\u015b\u0101ca worship is called \u201cblack arts\u201d or \u201cblack magic.\u201d There are many men who practice this black art, and they think that it is spiritualism, but such activities are completely materialistic. Similarly, a pure devotee, who worships the Supreme Personality of Godhead only, achieves the planets of Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47aloka without a doubt. It is very easy to understand through this important verse that if by simply worshiping the demigods one can achieve the heavenly planets, or by worshiping the Pit\u0101s achieve the Pit\u0101 planets, or by practicing the black arts achieve the ghostly planets, why can the pure devotee not achieve the planet of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a or Vi\u1e63\u1e47u? Unfortunately many people have no information of these sublime planets where K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and Vi\u1e63\u1e47u live, and because they do not know of them they fall down. Even the impersonalists fall down from the brahma-jyotir. The K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement is therefore distributing sublime information to the entire human society to the effect that by simply chanting the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mantra one can become perfect in this life and go back home, back to Godhead."}
