Living only for the satisfaction of the senses, such a person lives in vain.PurportThe mammonist philosophy of \u201cwork very hard and enjoy sense gratification\u201d is condemned herein by the Lord. Therefore, for those who want to enjoy this material world, the above-mentioned cycle of performing yaj\u00f1as is absolutely necessary. One who does not follow such regulations is living a very risky life, being condemned more and more. By nature\u2019s law, this human form of life is specifically meant for self-realization, in either of the three ways \u2013 namely karma-yoga, j\u00f1\u0101na-yoga or bhakti-yoga. There is no necessity of rigidly following the performances of the prescribed yaj\u00f1as for the transcendentalists who are above vice and virtue; but those who are engaged in sense gratification require purification by the above-mentioned cycle of yaj\u00f1a performances. There are different kinds of activities. Those who are not K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious are certainly engaged in sensory consciousness; therefore they need to execute pious work. The yaj\u00f1a system is planned in such a way that sensory conscious persons may satisfy their desires without becoming entangled in the reaction of sense-gratificatory work. The prosperity of the world depends not on our own efforts but on the background arrangement of the Supreme Lord, directly carried out by the demigods. Therefore, the yaj\u00f1as are directly aimed at the particular demigods mentioned in the Vedas. Indirectly, it is the practice of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, because when one masters the performance of yaj\u00f1as one is sure to become K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious. But if by performing yaj\u00f1as one does not become K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious, such principles are counted as only moral codes. One should not, therefore, limit his progress only to the point of moral codes, but should transcend them, to attain K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness."}
