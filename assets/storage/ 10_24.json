Of generals I am K\u0101rttikeya, and of bodies of water I am the ocean.PurportIndra is the chief demigod of the heavenly planets and is known as the king of the heavens. The planet on which he reigns is called Indraloka. B\u1e5bhaspati is Indra\u2019s priest, and since Indra is the chief of all kings, B\u1e5bhaspati is the chief of all priests. And as Indra is the chief of all kings, similarly Skanda, or K\u0101rttikeya, the son of P\u0101rvat\u012b and Lord \u015aiva, is the chief of all military commanders. And of all bodies of water, the ocean is the greatest. These representations of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a only give hints of His greatness."}
