For them I am covered by My internal potency, and therefore they do not know that I am unborn and infallible.I am never manifest to the foolish and unintelligent. For them I am covered by My internal potency, and therefore they do not know that I am unborn and infallible.PurportIt may be argued that since K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was visible to everyone when He was present on this earth, how can it be said that He is not manifest to everyone? But actually He was not manifest to everyone. When K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was present there were only a few people who could understand Him to be the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In the assembly of Kurus, when \u015ai\u015bup\u0101la spoke against K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s being elected president of the assembly, Bh\u012b\u1e63ma supported Him and proclaimed Him to be the Supreme God. Similarly, the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas and a few others knew that He was the Supreme, but not everyone. He was not revealed to the nondevotees and the common man. Therefore in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says that but for His pure devotees, all men consider Him to be like themselves. He was manifest only to His devotees as the reservoir of all pleasure. But to others, to unintelligent nondevotees, He was covered by His internal potency.In the prayers of Kunt\u012b in the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (1.8.19) it is said that the Lord is covered by the curtain of yoga-m\u0101y\u0101 and thus ordinary people cannot understand Him. This yoga-m\u0101y\u0101 curtain is also confirmed in the \u012a\u015bopani\u1e63ad (Mantra 15), in which the devotee prays:hira\u1e47mayena p\u0101tre\u1e47asatyasy\u0101pihita\u1e41 mukhamtat tva\u1e41 p\u016b\u1e63ann ap\u0101v\u1e5b\u1e47usatya-dharm\u0101ya d\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6daye\u201cO my Lord, You are the maintainer of the entire universe, and devotional service to You is the highest religious principle. Therefore, I pray that You will also maintain me. Your transcendental form is covered by the yoga-m\u0101y\u0101. The brahma-jyotir is the covering of the internal potency. May You kindly remove this glowing effulgence that impedes my seeing Your sac-cid-\u0101nanda-vigraha, Your eternal form of bliss and knowledge.\u201d The Supreme Personality of Godhead in His transcendental form of bliss and knowledge is covered by the internal potency of the brahma-jyotir, and the less intelligent impersonalists cannot see the Supreme on this account.Also in the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (10.14.7) there is this prayer by Brahm\u0101: \u201cO Supreme Personality of Godhead, O Supersoul, O master of all mystery, who can calculate Your potency and pastimes in this world? You are always expanding Your internal potency, and therefore no one can understand You. Learned scientists and learned scholars can examine the atomic constitution of the material world or even the planets, but still they are unable to calculate Your energy and potency, although You are present before them.\u201d The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, is not only unborn but also avyaya, inexhaustible. His eternal form is bliss and knowledge, and His energies are all inexhaustible."}
