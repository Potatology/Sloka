The sense of an existence separate from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is called m\u0101y\u0101 (m\u0101 \u2013 not, y\u0101 \u2013 this). Some think that we have nothing to do with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is only a great historical personality and that the Absolute is the impersonal Brahman. Factually, as it is stated in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, this impersonal Brahman is the personal effulgence of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is the cause of everything. In the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 it is clearly stated that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the cause of all causes. Even the millions of incarnations are only His different expansions. Similarly, the living entities are also expansions of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b philosophers wrongly think that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a loses His own separate existence in His many expansions. This thought is material in nature. We have experience in the material world that a thing, when fragmentally distributed, loses its own original identity. But the M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b philosophers fail to understand that absolute means that one plus one is equal to one, and that one minus one is also equal to one. This is the case in the absolute world.For want of sufficient knowledge in the absolute science, we are now covered with illusion, and therefore we think that we are separate from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Although we are separated parts of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, we are nevertheless not different from Him. The bodily difference of the living entities is m\u0101y\u0101, or not actual fact. We are all meant to satisfy K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. By m\u0101y\u0101 alone Arjuna thought that the temporary bodily relationship with his kinsmen was more important than his eternal spiritual relationship with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The whole teaching of the G\u012bt\u0101 is targeted toward this end: that a living being, as K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s eternal servitor, cannot be separated from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and his sense of being an identity apart from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is called m\u0101y\u0101. The living entities, as separate parts and parcels of the Supreme, have a purpose to fulfill. Having forgotten that purpose since time immemorial, they are situated in different bodies, as men, animals, demigods, etc. Such bodily differences arise from forgetfulness of the transcendental service of the Lord. But when one is engaged in transcendental service through K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, one becomes at once liberated from this illusion. One can acquire such pure knowledge only from the bona fide spiritual master and thereby avoid the delusion that the living entity is equal to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Perfect knowledge is that the Supreme Soul, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, is the supreme shelter for all living entities, and giving up such shelter, the living entities are deluded by the material energy, imagining themselves to have a separate identity. Thus, under different standards of material identity, they become forgetful of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. When, however, such deluded living entities become situated in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, it is to be understood that they are on the path of liberation, as confirmed in the Bh\u0101gavatam (2.10.6): muktir hitv\u0101nyath\u0101-r\u016bpa\u1e41 svar\u016bpe\u1e47a vyavasthiti\u1e25. Liberation means to be situated in one\u2019s constitutional position as an eternal servitor of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a (K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness)."}
