The prime sv\u0101rtha-gati, or goal of self-interest, is to reach Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. The whole institution of var\u1e47a and \u0101\u015brama is designed to help us reach this goal of life. A householder can also reach this destination by regulated service in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. For self-realization, one can live a controlled life, as prescribed in the \u015b\u0101stras, and continue carrying out his business without attachment, and in that way make progress. A sincere person who follows this method is far better situated than the false pretender who adopts show-bottle spiritualism to cheat the innocent public. A sincere sweeper in the street is far better than the charlatan meditator who meditates only for the sake of making a living."}
