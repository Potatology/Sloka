In the var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama institution, the fourth stage of life, namely the renounced order (sanny\u0101sa), is a painstaking situation. But one who is serious about making his life perfect surely adopts the sanny\u0101sa order of life in spite of all difficulties. The difficulties usually arise from having to sever family relationships, to give up the connection of wife and children. But if anyone is able to tolerate such difficulties, surely his path to spiritual realization is complete. Similarly, in Arjuna\u2019s discharge of duties as a k\u1e63atriya, he is advised to persevere, even if it is difficult to fight with his family members or similarly beloved persons. Lord Caitanya took sanny\u0101sa at the age of twenty-four, and His dependents, young wife as well as old mother, had no one else to look after them. Yet for a higher cause He took sanny\u0101sa and was steady in the discharge of higher duties. That is the way of achieving liberation from material bondage."}
