In what various forms are You to be remembered, O Supreme Personality of Godhead?O K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, O supreme mystic, how shall I constantly think of You, and how shall I know You? In what various forms are You to be remembered, O Supreme Personality of Godhead?PurportAs it is stated in the previous chapter, the Supreme Personality of Godhead is covered by His yoga-m\u0101y\u0101. Only surrendered souls and devotees can see Him. Now Arjuna is convinced that his friend, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, is the Supreme Godhead, but he wants to know the general process by which the all-pervading Lord can be understood by the common man. Common men, including the demons and atheists, cannot know K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, because He is guarded by His yoga-m\u0101y\u0101 energy. Again, these questions are asked by Arjuna for their benefit. The superior devotee is concerned not only for his own understanding but for the understanding of all mankind. So Arjuna, out of his mercy, because he is a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava, a devotee, is opening for the common man the understanding of the all-pervasiveness of the Supreme Lord. He addresses K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a specifically as yogin because \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the master of the yoga-m\u0101y\u0101 energy, by which He is covered and uncovered to the common man. The common man who has no love for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a cannot always think of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a; therefore he has to think materially. Arjuna is considering the mode of thinking of the materialistic persons of this world. The words ke\u1e63u ke\u1e63u ca bh\u0101ve\u1e63u refer to material nature (the word bh\u0101va means \u201cphysical things\u201d). Because materialists cannot understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a spiritually, they are advised to concentrate the mind on physical things and try to see how K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is manifested by physical representations."}
