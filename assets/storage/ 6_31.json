The yog\u012b should know that Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is not different from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in this form of Supersoul is situated in everyone\u2019s heart. Furthermore, there is no difference between the innumerable Supersouls present in the innumerable hearts of living entities. Nor is there a difference between a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person always engaged in the transcendental loving service of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and a perfect yog\u012b engaged in meditation on the Supersoul. The yog\u012b in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness \u2013 even though he may be engaged in various activities while in material existence \u2013 remains always situated in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. This is confirmed in the Bhakti-ras\u0101m\u1e5bta-sindhu (1.2.187) of \u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b: nikhil\u0101sv apy avasth\u0101su j\u012bvan-mukta\u1e25 sa ucyate. A devotee of the Lord, always acting in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, is automatically liberated. In the N\u0101rada Pa\u00f1car\u0101tra this is confirmed in this way:dik-k\u0101l\u0101dy-anavacchinnek\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47e ceto vidh\u0101ya catan-mayo bhavati k\u1e63ipra\u1e41j\u012bvo brahma\u1e47i yojayet\u201cBy concentrating one\u2019s attention on the transcendental form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who is all-pervading and beyond time and space, one becomes absorbed in thinking of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and then attains the happy state of transcendental association with Him.\u201dK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is the highest stage of trance in yoga practice. This very understanding that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is present as Param\u0101tm\u0101 in everyone\u2019s heart makes the yog\u012b faultless. The Vedas (Gop\u0101la-t\u0101pan\u012b Upani\u1e63ad 1.21) confirm this inconceivable potency of the Lord as follows: eko \u2019pi san bahudh\u0101 yo \u2019vabh\u0101ti. \u201cAlthough the Lord is one, He is present in innumerable hearts as many.\u201d Similarly, in the sm\u1e5bti-\u015b\u0101stra it is said:eka eva paro vi\u1e63\u1e47u\u1e25sarva-vy\u0101p\u012b na sa\u1e41\u015baya\u1e25ai\u015bvary\u0101d r\u016bpam eka\u1e41 cas\u016brya-vat bahudheyate\u201cVi\u1e63\u1e47u is one, and yet He is certainly all-pervading. By His inconceivable potency, in spite of His one form, He is present everywhere, as the sun appears in many places at once.\u201d"}
