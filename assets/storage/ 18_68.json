Those who do not accept K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as He is and Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 as it is should not try to explain Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 whimsically and become offenders. Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 should be explained to persons who are ready to accept K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. It is a subject matter for the devotees only and not for philosophical speculators. Anyone, however, who tries sincerely to present Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 as it is will advance in devotional activities and reach the pure devotional state of life. As a result of such pure devotion, he is sure to go back home, back to Godhead."}
