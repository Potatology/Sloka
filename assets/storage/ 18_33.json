One who is steadily fixed in the Supreme Soul with determination, concentrating one\u2019s mind, life and sensory activities on the Supreme, engages in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. That sort of determination is in the mode of goodness. The word avyabhic\u0101ri\u1e47y\u0101 is very significant, for it indicates that persons who are engaged in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness are never deviated by any other activity."}
