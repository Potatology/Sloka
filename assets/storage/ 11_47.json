No one before you has ever seen this primal form, unlimited and full of glaring effulgence.PurportArjuna wanted to see the universal form of the Supreme Lord, so Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, out of His mercy upon His devotee Arjuna, showed His universal form, full of effulgence and opulence. This form was glaring like the sun, and its many faces were rapidly changing. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a showed this form just to satisfy the desire of His friend Arjuna. This form was manifested by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a through His internal potency, which is inconceivable by human speculation. No one had seen this universal form of the Lord before Arjuna, but because the form was shown to Arjuna, other devotees in the heavenly planets and in other planets in outer space could also see it. They had not seen it before, but because of Arjuna they were also able to see it. In other words, all the disciplic devotees of the Lord could see the universal form which was shown to Arjuna by the mercy of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Someone has commented that this form was shown to Duryodhana also when K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a went to Duryodhana to negotiate for peace. Unfortunately, Duryodhana did not accept the peace offer, but at that time K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a manifested some of His universal forms. But those forms are different from this one shown to Arjuna. It is clearly said that no one had ever seen this form before."}
