Indirectly, by the symbolism of the conchshell, he informed his depressed grandson Duryodhana that he had no chance of victory in the battle, because the Supreme Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was on the other side. But still, it was his duty to conduct the fight, and no pains would be spared in that connection."}
