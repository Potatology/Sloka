King Bharata was the emperor of the world, and since his time this planet has been known among the demigods as Bh\u0101rata-var\u1e63a. Formerly it was known as Il\u0101v\u1e5bta-var\u1e63a. The emperor, at an early age, retired for spiritual perfection but failed to achieve success. In his next life he took birth in the family of a good br\u0101hma\u1e47a and was known as Ja\u1e0da Bharata because he always remained secluded and did not talk to anyone. And later on he was discovered as the greatest transcendentalist by King Rah\u016bga\u1e47a. From his life it is understood that transcendental endeavors, or the practice of yoga, never go in vain. By the grace of the Lord the transcendentalist gets repeated opportunities for complete perfection in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness."}
