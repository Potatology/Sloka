That statement is:vaya\u1e41 tu na vit\u1e5bpy\u0101mauttama-\u015bloka-vikrameyac ch\u1e5b\u1e47vat\u0101\u1e41 rasa-j\u00f1\u0101n\u0101\u1e41sv\u0101du sv\u0101du pade pade\u201cOne can never be satiated even though one continuously hears the transcendental pastimes of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who is glorified by excellent prayers. Those who have entered into a transcendental relationship with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a relish at every step the descriptions of the pastimes of the Lord.\u201d (\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam 1.1.19) Thus Arjuna is interested in hearing about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and specifically how He remains as the all-pervading Supreme Lord.Now as far as am\u1e5btam, nectar, is concerned, any narration or statement concerning K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is just like nectar. And this nectar can be perceived by practical experience. Modern stories, fiction and histories are different from the transcendental pastimes of the Lord in that one will tire of hearing mundane stories but one never tires of hearing about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. It is for this reason only that the history of the whole universe is replete with references to the pastimes of the incarnations of Godhead. The Pur\u0101\u1e47as are histories of bygone ages that relate the pastimes of the various incarnations of the Lord. In this way the reading matter remains forever fresh, despite repeated readings."}
