They are actually Brahman because they entirely know everything about transcendental activities.Intelligent persons who are endeavoring for liberation from old age and death take refuge in Me in devotional service. They are actually Brahman because they entirely know everything about transcendental activities.PurportBirth, death, old age and diseases affect this material body, but not the spiritual body. There is no birth, death, old age and disease for the spiritual body, so one who attains a spiritual body, becomes one of the associates of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and engages in eternal devotional service is really liberated. Aha\u1e41 brahm\u0101smi: I am spirit. It is said that one should understand that he is Brahman, spirit soul. This Brahman conception of life is also in devotional service, as described in this verse. The pure devotees are transcendentally situated on the Brahman platform, and they know everything about transcendental activities.Four kinds of impure devotees who engage themselves in the transcendental service of the Lord achieve their respective goals, and by the grace of the Supreme Lord, when they are fully K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious, they actually enjoy spiritual association with the Supreme Lord. But those who are worshipers of demigods never reach the Supreme Lord in His supreme planet. Even the less intelligent Brahman-realized persons cannot reach the supreme planet of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a known as Goloka V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana. Only persons who perform activities in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness (m\u0101m \u0101\u015britya) are actually entitled to be called Brahman, because they are actually endeavoring to reach the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a planet. Such persons have no misgivings about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and thus they are factually Brahman.Those who are engaged in worshiping the form or arc\u0101 of the Lord, or who are engaged in meditation on the Lord simply for liberation from material bondage, also know, by the grace of the Lord, the purports of Brahman, adhibh\u016bta, etc., as explained by the Lord in the next chapter."}
