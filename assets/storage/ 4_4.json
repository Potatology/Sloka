How am I to understand that in the beginning You instructed this science to him?PurportArjuna is an accepted devotee of the Lord, so how could he not believe K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s words? The fact is that Arjuna is not inquiring for himself but for those who do not believe in the Supreme Personality of Godhead or for the demons who do not like the idea that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a should be accepted as the Supreme Personality of Godhead; for them only Arjuna inquires on this point, as if he were himself not aware of the Personality of Godhead, or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. As it will be evident from the Tenth Chapter, Arjuna knew perfectly well that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the fountainhead of everything and the last word in transcendence. Of course, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a also appeared as the son of Devak\u012b on this earth. How K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a remained the same Supreme Personality of Godhead, the eternal original person, is very difficult for an ordinary man to understand. Therefore, to clarify this point, Arjuna put this question before K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a so that He Himself could speak authoritatively. That K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the supreme authority is accepted by the whole world, not only at present but from time immemorial, and the demons alone reject Him. Anyway, since K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the authority accepted by all, Arjuna put this question before Him in order that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a would describe Himself without being depicted by the demons, who always try to distort Him in a way understandable to the demons and their followers. It is necessary that everyone, for his own interest, know the science of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Therefore, when K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself speaks about Himself, it is auspicious for all the worlds. To the demons, such explanations by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself may appear to be strange because the demons always study K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a from their own standpoint, but those who are devotees heartily welcome the statements of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a when they are spoken by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself. The devotees will always worship such authoritative statements of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a because they are always eager to know more and more about Him. The atheists, who consider K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a an ordinary man, may in this way come to know that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is superhuman, that He is sac-cid-\u0101nanda-vigraha \u2013 the eternal form of bliss and knowledge \u2013 that He is transcendental, and that He is above the domination of the modes of material nature and above the influence of time and space. A devotee of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, like Arjuna, is undoubtedly above any misunderstanding of the transcendental position of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Arjuna\u2019s putting this question before the Lord is simply an attempt by the devotee to defy the atheistic attitude of persons who consider K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to be an ordinary human being, subject to the modes of material nature."}
