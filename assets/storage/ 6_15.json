Yoga practice is not meant for attaining any kind of material facility; it is to enable the cessation of all material existence. One who seeks an improvement in health or aspires after material perfection is no yog\u012b according to Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. Nor does cessation of material existence entail one\u2019s entering into \u201cthe void,\u201d which is only a myth. There is no void anywhere within the creation of the Lord. Rather, the cessation of material existence enables one to enter into the spiritual sky, the abode of the Lord. The abode of the Lord is also clearly described in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 as that place where there is no need of sun, moon or electricity. All the planets in the spiritual kingdom are self-illuminated like the sun in the material sky. The kingdom of God is everywhere, but the spiritual sky and the planets thereof are called para\u1e41 dh\u0101ma, or superior abodes.A consummate yog\u012b, who is perfect in understanding Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, as is clearly stated herein by the Lord Himself (mat-citta\u1e25, mat-para\u1e25, mat-sth\u0101nam), can attain real peace and can ultimately reach His supreme abode, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47aloka, known as Goloka V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana. In the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 (5.37) it is clearly stated, goloka eva nivasaty akhil\u0101tma-bh\u016bta\u1e25: the Lord, although residing always in His abode called Goloka, is the all-pervading Brahman and the localized Param\u0101tm\u0101 as well by dint of His superior spiritual energies. No one can reach the spiritual sky (Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha) or enter into the Lord\u2019s eternal abode (Goloka V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana) without the proper understanding of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and His plenary expansion Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. Therefore a person working in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is the perfect yog\u012b, because his mind is always absorbed in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s activities (sa vai mana\u1e25 k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-pad\u0101ravindayo\u1e25). In the Vedas also (\u015avet\u0101\u015bvatara Upani\u1e63ad 3.8) we learn, tam eva viditv\u0101ti m\u1e5btyum eti: \u201cOne can overcome the path of birth and death only by understanding the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\u201d In other words, perfection of the yoga system is the attainment of freedom from material existence and not some magical jugglery or gymnastic feats to befool innocent people."}
