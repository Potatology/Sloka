The whole Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 centers around the declaration that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. That is the version of all Vedic literature. Para-tattva means the Supreme Reality, who is understood by the knowers of the Supreme as Brahman, Param\u0101tm\u0101 and Bhagav\u0101n. Bhagav\u0101n, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is the last word in the Absolute. There is nothing more than that. The Lord says, matta\u1e25 paratara\u1e41 n\u0101nyat ki\u00f1cid asti dhana\u00f1-jaya. Impersonal Brahman is also supported by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a: brahma\u1e47o hi prati\u1e63\u1e6dh\u0101ham. Therefore in all ways K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Reality. One whose mind, intelligence, faith and refuge are always in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, or, in other words, one who is fully in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, is undoubtedly washed clean of all misgivings and is in perfect knowledge in everything concerning transcendence. A K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person can thoroughly understand that there is duality (simultaneous identity and individuality) in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and, equipped with such transcendental knowledge, one can make steady progress on the path of liberation."}
