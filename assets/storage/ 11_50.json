Similarly, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a knew that Arjuna was not interested in seeing a four-handed form, but since Arjuna asked to see this four-handed form, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a also showed him this form again and then showed Himself in His two-handed form. The word saumya-vapu\u1e25 is very significant. Saumya-vapu\u1e25 is a very beautiful form; it is known as the most beautiful form. When He was present, everyone was attracted simply by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s form, and because K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the director of the universe, He just banished the fear of Arjuna, His devotee, and showed him again His beautiful form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. In the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 (5.38) it is stated, prem\u0101\u00f1jana-cchurita-bhakti-vilocanena: only a person whose eyes are smeared with the ointment of love can see the beautiful form of \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a."}
