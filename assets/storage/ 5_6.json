But a thoughtful person engaged in devotional service can achieve the Supreme without delay.PurportThere are two classes of sanny\u0101s\u012bs, or persons in the renounced order of life. The M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b sanny\u0101s\u012bs are engaged in the study of S\u0101\u1e45khya philosophy, whereas the Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava sanny\u0101s\u012bs are engaged in the study of Bh\u0101gavatam philosophy, which affords the proper commentary on the Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btras. The M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b sanny\u0101s\u012bs also study the Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btras, but use their own commentary, called \u015a\u0101r\u012braka-bh\u0101\u1e63ya, written by \u015aa\u1e45kar\u0101c\u0101rya. The students of the Bh\u0101gavata school are engaged in the devotional service of the Lord, according to p\u0101\u00f1car\u0101trik\u012b regulations, and therefore the Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava sanny\u0101s\u012bs have multiple engagements in the transcendental service of the Lord. The Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava sanny\u0101s\u012bs have nothing to do with material activities, and yet they perform various activities in their devotional service to the Lord. But the M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b sanny\u0101s\u012bs, engaged in the studies of S\u0101\u1e45khya and Ved\u0101nta and speculation, cannot relish the transcendental service of the Lord. Because their studies become very tedious, they sometimes become tired of Brahman speculation, and thus they take shelter of the Bh\u0101gavatam without proper understanding. Consequently their study of the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam becomes troublesome. Dry speculations and impersonal interpretations by artificial means are all useless for the M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b sanny\u0101s\u012bs. The Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava sanny\u0101s\u012bs, who are engaged in devotional service, are happy in the discharge of their transcendental duties, and they have the guarantee of ultimate entrance into the kingdom of God. The M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b sanny\u0101s\u012bs sometimes fall down from the path of self-realization and again enter into material activities of a philanthropic and altruistic nature, which are nothing but material engagements. Therefore, the conclusion is that those who are engaged in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious activities are better situated than the sanny\u0101s\u012bs engaged in simple speculation about what is Brahman and what is not Brahman, although they too come to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, after many births."}
