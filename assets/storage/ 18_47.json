Duties prescribed according to one\u2019s nature are never affected by sinful reactions.It is better to engage in one\u2019s own occupation, even though one may perform it imperfectly, than to accept another\u2019s occupation and perform it perfectly. Duties prescribed according to one\u2019s nature are never affected by sinful reactions.PurportOne\u2019s occupational duty is prescribed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. As already discussed in previous verses, the duties of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a, k\u1e63atriya, vai\u015bya and \u015b\u016bdra are prescribed according to their particular modes of nature. One should not imitate another\u2019s duty. A man who is by nature attracted to the kind of work done by \u015b\u016bdras should not artificially claim to be a br\u0101hma\u1e47a, although he may have been born into a br\u0101hma\u1e47a family. In this way one should work according to his own nature; no work is abominable, if performed in the service of the Supreme Lord. The occupational duty of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a is certainly in the mode of goodness, but if a person is not by nature in the mode of goodness, he should not imitate the occupational duty of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a. For a k\u1e63atriya, or administrator, there are so many abominable things; a k\u1e63atriya has to be violent to kill his enemies, and sometimes a k\u1e63atriya has to tell lies for the sake of diplomacy. Such violence and duplicity accompany political affairs, but a k\u1e63atriya is not supposed to give up his occupational duty and try to perform the duties of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a.One should act to satisfy the Supreme Lord. For example, Arjuna was a k\u1e63atriya. He was hesitating to fight the other party. But if such fighting is performed for the sake of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, there need be no fear of degradation. In the business field also, sometimes a merchant has to tell so many lies to make a profit. If he does not do so, there can be no profit. Sometimes a merchant says, \u201cOh, my dear customer, for you I am making no profit,\u201d but one should know that without profit the merchant cannot exist. Therefore it should be taken as a simple lie if a merchant says that he is not making a profit. But the merchant should not think that because he is engaged in an occupation in which the telling of lies is compulsory, he should give up his profession and pursue the profession of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a. That is not recommended. Whether one is a k\u1e63atriya, a vai\u015bya, or a \u015b\u016bdra doesn\u2019t matter, if he serves, by his work, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Even br\u0101hma\u1e47as, who perform different types of sacrifice, sometimes must kill animals because sometimes animals are sacrificed in such ceremonies. Similarly, if a k\u1e63atriya engaged in his own occupation kills an enemy, there is no sin incurred. In the Third Chapter these matters have been clearly and elaborately explained; every man should work for the purpose of Yaj\u00f1a, or for Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Anything done for personal sense gratification is a cause of bondage. The conclusion is that everyone should be engaged according to the particular mode of nature he has acquired, and he should decide to work only to serve the supreme cause of the Supreme Lord."}
