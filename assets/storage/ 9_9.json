I am ever detached from all these material activities, seated as though neutral.PurportOne should not think, in this connection, that the Supreme Personality of Godhead has no engagement. In His spiritual world He is always engaged. In the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 (5.6) it is stated, \u0101tm\u0101r\u0101masya tasy\u0101sti prak\u1e5bty\u0101 na sam\u0101gama\u1e25: \u201cHe is always involved in His eternal, blissful, spiritual activities, but He has nothing to do with these material activities.\u201d Material activities are being carried on by His different potencies. The Lord is always neutral in the material activities of the created world. This neutrality is mentioned here with the word ud\u0101s\u012bna-vat. Although He has control over every minute detail of material activities, He is sitting as if neutral. The example can be given of a high-court judge sitting on his bench. By his order so many things are happening \u2013 someone is being hanged, someone is being put into jail, someone is awarded a huge amount of wealth \u2013 but still he is neutral. He has nothing to do with all that gain and loss. Similarly, the Lord is always neutral, although He has His hand in every sphere of activity. In the Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra (2.1.34) it is stated, vai\u1e63amya-nairgh\u1e5b\u1e47ye na: He is not situated in the dualities of this material world. He is transcendental to these dualities. Nor is He attached to the creation and annihilation of this material world. The living entities take their different forms in the various species of life according to their past deeds, and the Lord doesn\u2019t interfere with them."}
