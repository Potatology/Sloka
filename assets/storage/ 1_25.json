The use of the word H\u1e5b\u1e63\u012bke\u015ba in this connection indicates that He knew everything. And the word P\u0101rtha, meaning \u201cthe son of P\u1e5bth\u0101, or Kunt\u012b,\u201d is also similarly significant in reference to Arjuna. As a friend, He wanted to inform Arjuna that because Arjuna was the son of P\u1e5bth\u0101, the sister of His own father Vasudeva, He had agreed to be the charioteer of Arjuna. Now what did K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mean when He told Arjuna to \u201cbehold the Kurus\u201d? Did Arjuna want to stop there and not fight? K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a never expected such things from the son of His aunt P\u1e5bth\u0101. The mind of Arjuna was thus predicted by the Lord in friendly joking."}
