Although He is present in His abode, He is all-pervading, and everything is situated within Him.PurportIt is here clearly stated that the supreme destination, from which there is no return, is the abode of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme Person. The Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 describes this supreme abode as \u0101nanda-cinmaya-rasa, a place where everything is full of spiritual bliss. All the variegatedness manifest there is of the quality of spiritual bliss \u2013 nothing there is material. That variegatedness is expanded as the spiritual expansion of the Supreme Godhead Himself, for the manifestation there is totally of the spiritual energy, as explained in Chapter Seven. As far as this material world is concerned, although the Lord is always in His supreme abode, He is nonetheless all-pervading by His material energy. So by His spiritual and material energies He is present everywhere \u2013 both in the material and in the spiritual universes. Yasy\u0101nta\u1e25-sth\u0101ni means that everything is sustained within Him, within either His spiritual or material energy. The Lord is all-pervading by these two energies.To enter K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s supreme abode or the innumerable Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha planets is possible only by bhakti, devotional service, as clearly indicated here by the word bhakty\u0101. No other process can help one attain that supreme abode. The Vedas (Gop\u0101la-t\u0101pan\u012b Upani\u1e63ad 1.21) also describe the supreme abode and the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Eko va\u015b\u012b sarva-ga\u1e25 k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u1e25. In that abode there is only one Supreme Personality of Godhead, whose name is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. He is the supreme merciful Deity, and although situated there as one He has expanded Himself into millions and millions of plenary expansions. The Vedas compare the Lord to a tree standing still yet bearing many varieties of fruits, flowers and changing leaves. The plenary expansions of the Lord who preside over the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha planets are four-armed, and they are known by a variety of names \u2013 Puru\u1e63ottama, Trivikrama, Ke\u015bava, M\u0101dhava, Aniruddha, H\u1e5b\u1e63\u012bke\u015ba, Sa\u1e45kar\u1e63a\u1e47a, Pradyumna, \u015ar\u012bdhara, V\u0101sudeva, D\u0101modara, Jan\u0101rdana, N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, V\u0101mana, Padman\u0101bha, etc.The Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 (5.37) also confirms that although the Lord is always in the supreme abode, Goloka V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, He is all-pervading, so that everything is going on nicely (goloka eva nivasaty akhil\u0101tma-bh\u016bta\u1e25). As stated in the Vedas (\u015avet\u0101\u015bvatara Upani\u1e63ad 6.8), par\u0101sya \u015baktir vividhaiva \u015br\u016byate/ sv\u0101bh\u0101vik\u012b j\u00f1\u0101na-bala-kriy\u0101 ca: His energies are so expansive that they systematically conduct everything in the cosmic manifestation without a flaw, although the Supreme Lord is far, far away."}
