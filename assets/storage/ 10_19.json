The senses of the individual soul are limited and do not permit him to understand the totality of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s affairs. Still the devotees try to understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, but not on the principle that they will be able to understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a fully at any specific time or in any state of life. Rather, the very topics of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a are so relishable that they appear to the devotees as nectar. Thus the devotees enjoy them. In discussing K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s opulences and His diverse energies, the pure devotees take transcendental pleasure. Therefore they want to hear and discuss them. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a knows that living entities do not understand the extent of His opulences; He therefore agrees to state only the principal manifestations of His different energies. The word pr\u0101dh\u0101nyata\u1e25 (\u201cprincipal\u201d) is very important because we can understand only a few of the principal details of the Supreme Lord, for His features are unlimited. It is not possible to understand them all. And vibh\u016bti, as used in this verse, refers to the opulences by which He controls the whole manifestation. In the Amara-ko\u015ba dictionary it is stated that vibh\u016bti indicates an exceptional opulence.The impersonalist or pantheist cannot understand the exceptional opulences of the Supreme Lord nor the manifestations of His divine energies. Both in the material world and in the spiritual world His energies are distributed in every variety of manifestation. Now K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is describing what can be directly perceived by the common man; thus part of His variegated energy is described in this way."}
