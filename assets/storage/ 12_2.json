For one in such K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness there are no material activities, because everything is done for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. A pure devotee is constantly engaged. Sometimes he chants, sometimes he hears or reads books about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, or sometimes he cooks pras\u0101dam or goes to the marketplace to purchase something for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, or sometimes he washes the temple or the dishes \u2013 whatever he does, he does not let a single moment pass without devoting his activities to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Such action is in full sam\u0101dhi."}
