The living entity has no separate independent identity. He is the marginal energy of the Supreme. When he is entrapped by material energy, he is conditioned, and when he is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious, or aware of the spiritual energy, then he is in his real and natural state of life. Therefore, when one is in complete knowledge, one ceases all material sense gratification, or renounces all kinds of sense gratificatory activities. This is practiced by the yog\u012bs who restrain the senses from material attachment. But a person in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness has no opportunity to engage his senses in anything which is not for the purpose of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Therefore, a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person is simultaneously a sanny\u0101s\u012b and a yog\u012b. The purpose of knowledge and of restraining the senses, as prescribed in the j\u00f1\u0101na and yoga processes, is automatically served in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. If one is unable to give up the activities of his selfish nature, then j\u00f1\u0101na and yoga are of no avail. The real aim is for a living entity to give up all selfish satisfaction and to be prepared to satisfy the Supreme. A K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person has no desire for any kind of self-enjoyment. He is always engaged for the enjoyment of the Supreme. One who has no information of the Supreme must therefore be engaged in self-satisfaction, because no one can stand on the platform of inactivity. All purposes are perfectly served by the practice of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness."}
