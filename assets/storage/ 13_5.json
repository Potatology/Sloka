It is especially presented in Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra with all reasoning as to cause and effect.That knowledge of the field of activities and of the knower of activities is described by various sages in various Vedic writings. It is especially presented in Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra with all reasoning as to cause and effect.PurportThe Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, is the highest authority in explaining this knowledge. Still, as a matter of course, learned scholars and standard authorities always give evidence from previous authorities. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is explaining this most controversial point regarding the duality and nonduality of the soul and the Supersoul by referring to a scripture, the Ved\u0101nta, which is accepted as authority. First He says, \u201cThis is according to different sages.\u201d As far as the sages are concerned, besides Himself, Vy\u0101sadeva (the author of the Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra) is a great sage, and in the Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra duality is perfectly explained. And Vy\u0101sadeva\u2019s father, Par\u0101\u015bara, is also a great sage, and he writes in his books of religiosity, aham tva\u1e41 ca tath\u0101nye.\u2026 \u201cwe \u2013 you, I and the various other living entities \u2013 are all transcendental, although in material bodies. Now we are fallen into the ways of the three modes of material nature according to our different karma. As such, some are on higher levels, and some are in the lower nature. The higher and lower natures exist due to ignorance and are being manifested in an infinite number of living entities. But the Supersoul, which is infallible, is uncontaminated by the three qualities of nature and is transcendental.\u201d Similarly, in the original Vedas, a distinction between the soul, the Supersoul and the body is made, especially in the Ka\u1e6dha Upani\u1e63ad. There are many great sages who have explained this, and Par\u0101\u015bara is considered principal among them.The word chandobhi\u1e25 refers to the various Vedic literatures. The Taittir\u012bya Upani\u1e63ad, for example, which is a branch of the Yajur Veda, describes nature, the living entity and the Supreme Personality of Godhead.As stated before, k\u1e63etra is the field of activities, and there are two kinds of k\u1e63etra-j\u00f1a: the individual living entity and the supreme living entity. As stated in the Taittir\u012bya Upani\u1e63ad (2.5), brahma puccha\u1e41 prati\u1e63\u1e6dh\u0101. There is a manifestation of the Supreme Lord\u2019s energy known as anna-maya, dependence upon food for existence. This is a materialistic realization of the Supreme. Then, in pr\u0101\u1e47a-maya, after realizing the Supreme Absolute Truth in food, one can realize the Absolute Truth in the living symptoms or life forms. In j\u00f1\u0101na-maya, realization extends beyond the living symptoms to the point of thinking, feeling and willing. Then there is Brahman realization, called vij\u00f1\u0101na-maya, in which the living entity\u2019s mind and life symptoms are distinguished from the living entity himself. The next and supreme stage is \u0101nanda-maya, realization of the all-blissful nature. Thus there are five stages of Brahman realization, which are called brahma puccham. Out of these, the first three \u2013 anna-maya, pr\u0101\u1e47a-maya and j\u00f1\u0101na-maya \u2013 involve the fields of activities of the living entities. Transcendental to all these fields of activities is the Supreme Lord, who is called \u0101nanda-maya. The Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra also describes the Supreme by saying, \u0101nanda-mayo \u2019bhy\u0101s\u0101t: the Supreme Personality of Godhead is by nature full of joy. To enjoy His transcendental bliss, He expands into vij\u00f1\u0101na-maya, pr\u0101\u1e47a-maya, j\u00f1\u0101na-maya and anna-maya. In the field of activities the living entity is considered to be the enjoyer, and different from him is the \u0101nanda-maya. That means that if the living entity decides to enjoy in dovetailing himself with the \u0101nanda-maya, then he becomes perfect. This is the real picture of the Supreme Lord as the supreme knower of the field, the living entity as the subordinate knower, and the nature of the field of activities. One has to search for this truth in the Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra, or Brahma-s\u016btra.It is mentioned here that the codes of the Brahma-s\u016btra are very nicely arranged according to cause and effect. Some of the s\u016btras, or aphorisms, are na viyad a\u015brute\u1e25 (2.3.2), n\u0101tm\u0101 \u015brute\u1e25 (2.3.18), and par\u0101t tu tac-chrute\u1e25 (2.3.40). The first aphorism indicates the field of activities, the second indicates the living entity, and the third indicates the Supreme Lord, the summum bonum among all the manifestations of various entities."}
