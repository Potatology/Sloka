The yog\u012b who falls after a short period of practice goes to the higher planets, where pious living entities are allowed to enter. After prolonged life there, one is sent back again to this planet, to take birth in the family of a righteous br\u0101hma\u1e47a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava or of aristocratic merchants.The real purpose of yoga practice is to achieve the highest perfection of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, as explained in the last verse of this chapter. But those who do not persevere to such an extent and who fail because of material allurements are allowed, by the grace of the Lord, to make full utilization of their material propensities. And after that, they are given opportunities to live prosperous lives in righteous or aristocratic families. Those who are born in such families may take advantage of the facilities and try to elevate themselves to full K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness."}
