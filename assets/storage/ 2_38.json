There is no consideration of happiness or distress, profit or loss, victory or defeat in the activities of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. That everything should be performed for the sake of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is transcendental consciousness; so there is no reaction to material activities. He who acts for his own sense gratification, either in goodness or in passion, is subject to the reaction, good or bad. But he who has completely surrendered himself in the activities of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is no longer obliged to anyone, nor is he a debtor to anyone, as one is in the ordinary course of activities. It is said:devar\u1e63i-bh\u016bt\u0101pta-n\u1e5b\u1e47\u0101\u1e41 pit\u1e5d\u1e47\u0101\u1e41na ki\u1e45karo n\u0101yam \u1e5b\u1e47\u012b ca r\u0101jansarv\u0101tman\u0101 ya\u1e25 \u015bara\u1e47a\u1e41 \u015bara\u1e47ya\u1e41gato mukunda\u1e41 parih\u1e5btya kartam\u201cAnyone who has completely surrendered unto K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Mukunda, giving up all other duties, is no longer a debtor, nor is he obliged to anyone \u2013 not the demigods, nor the sages, nor the people in general, nor kinsmen, nor humanity, nor forefathers.\u201d (Bh\u0101g. 11.5.41) That is the indirect hint given by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to Arjuna in this verse, and the matter will be more clearly explained in the following verses."}
