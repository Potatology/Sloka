The real spiritual master is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and He is imparting this spiritual knowledge to Arjuna. Similarly, it is from those who are fully in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness that one has to learn this science of activities in terms of the modes of nature. Otherwise, one\u2019s life will be misdirected. By the instruction of a bona fide spiritual master, a living entity can know of his spiritual position, his material body, his senses, how he is entrapped, and how he is under the spell of the material modes of nature. He is helpless, being in the grip of these modes, but when he can see his real position, then he can attain to the transcendental platform, having the scope for spiritual life. Actually, the living entity is not the performer of different activities. He is forced to act because he is situated in a particular type of body, conducted by some particular mode of material nature. Unless one has the help of spiritual authority, he cannot understand in what position he is actually situated. With the association of a bona fide spiritual master, he can see his real position, and by such an understanding he can become fixed in full K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. A man in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is not controlled by the spell of the material modes of nature. It has already been stated in the Seventh Chapter that one who has surrendered to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is relieved from the activities of material nature. For one who is able to see things as they are, the influence of material nature gradually ceases."}
