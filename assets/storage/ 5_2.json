As long as one is engaged in activities aimed at improving the standard of bodily comfort, one is sure to transmigrate to different types of bodies, thereby continuing material bondage perpetually. \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (5.5.4\u20136) confirms this as follows:n\u016bna\u1e41 pramatta\u1e25 kurute vikarmayad indriya-pr\u012btaya \u0101p\u1e5b\u1e47otina s\u0101dhu manye yata \u0101tmano \u2019yamasann api kle\u015ba-da \u0101sa deha\u1e25par\u0101bhavas t\u0101vad abodha-j\u0101toy\u0101van na jij\u00f1\u0101sata \u0101tma-tattvamy\u0101vat kriy\u0101s t\u0101vad ida\u1e41 mano vaikarm\u0101tmaka\u1e41 yena \u015bar\u012bra-bandha\u1e25eva\u1e41 mana\u1e25 karma-va\u015ba\u1e41 prayu\u1e45kteavidyay\u0101tmany upadh\u012byam\u0101nepr\u012btir na y\u0101van mayi v\u0101sudevena mucyate deha-yogena t\u0101vat\u201cPeople are mad after sense gratification, and they do not know that this present body, which is full of miseries, is a result of one\u2019s fruitive activities in the past. Although this body is temporary, it is always giving one trouble in many ways. Therefore, to act for sense gratification is not good. One is considered to be a failure in life as long as he makes no inquiry about his real identity. As long as he does not know his real identity, he has to work for fruitive results for sense gratification, and as long as one is engrossed in the consciousness of sense gratification one has to transmigrate from one body to another. Although the mind may be engrossed in fruitive activities and influenced by ignorance, one must develop a love for devotional service to V\u0101sudeva. Only then can one have the opportunity to get out of the bondage of material existence.\u201dTherefore, j\u00f1\u0101na (or knowledge that one is not this material body but spirit soul) is not sufficient for liberation. One has to act in the status of spirit soul, otherwise there is no escape from material bondage. Action in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is not, however, action on the fruitive platform. Activities performed in full knowledge strengthen one\u2019s advancement in real knowledge. Without K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, mere renunciation of fruitive activities does not actually purify the heart of a conditioned soul. As long as the heart is not purified, one has to work on the fruitive platform. But action in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness automatically helps one escape the result of fruitive action so that one need not descend to the material platform. Therefore action in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is always superior to renunciation, which always entails a risk of falling. Renunciation without K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is incomplete, as is confirmed by \u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b in his Bhakti-ras\u0101m\u1e5bta-sindhu (1.2.258):pr\u0101pa\u00f1cikatay\u0101 buddhy\u0101hari-sambandhi-vastuna\u1e25mumuk\u1e63ubhi\u1e25 parity\u0101govair\u0101gya\u1e41 phalgu kathyate\u201cWhen persons eager to achieve liberation renounce things related to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, thinking them to be material, their renunciation is called incomplete.\u201d Renunciation is complete when it is in the knowledge that everything in existence belongs to the Lord and that no one should claim proprietorship over anything. One should understand that, factually, nothing belongs to anyone. Then where is the question of renunciation? One who knows that everything is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s property is always situated in renunciation. Since everything belongs to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, everything should be employed in the service of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. This perfect form of action in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is far better than any amount of artificial renunciation by a sanny\u0101s\u012b of the M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b school."}
