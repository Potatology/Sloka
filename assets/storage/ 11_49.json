My devotee, be free again from all disturbances. With a peaceful mind you can now see the form you desire.PurportIn the beginning of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 Arjuna was worried about killing Bh\u012b\u1e63ma and Dro\u1e47a, his worshipful grandfather and master. But K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a said that he need not be afraid of killing his grandfather. When the sons of Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra tried to disrobe Draupad\u012b in the assembly of the Kurus, Bh\u012b\u1e63ma and Dro\u1e47a were silent, and for such negligence of duty they should be killed. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a showed His universal form to Arjuna just to show him that these people were already killed for their unlawful action. That scene was shown to Arjuna because devotees are always peaceful and they cannot perform such horrible actions. The purpose of the revelation of the universal form was shown; now Arjuna wanted to see the four-armed form, and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a showed him. A devotee is not much interested in the universal form, for it does not enable one to reciprocate loving feelings. Either a devotee wants to offer his respectful worshipful feelings, or he wants to see the two-handed K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a form so that he can reciprocate in loving service with the Supreme Personality of Godhead."}
