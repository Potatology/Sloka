O tiger among men, renunciation is declared in the scriptures to be of three kinds.PurportAlthough there are differences of opinion about renunciation, here the Supreme Personality of Godhead, \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, gives His judgment, which should be taken as final. After all, the Vedas are different laws given by the Lord. Here the Lord is personally present, and His word should be taken as final. The Lord says that the process of renunciation should be considered in terms of the modes of material nature in which it is performed."}
