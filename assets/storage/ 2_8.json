He could understand that his so-called knowledge was useless in driving away his problems, which were drying up his whole existence; and it was impossible for him to solve such perplexities without the help of a spiritual master like Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Academic knowledge, scholarship, high position, etc., are all useless in solving the problems of life; help can be given only by a spiritual master like K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Therefore, the conclusion is that a spiritual master who is one hundred percent K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious is the bona fide spiritual master, for he can solve the problems of life. Lord Caitanya said that one who is a master in the science of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, regardless of his social position, is the real spiritual master.kib\u0101 vipra, kib\u0101 ny\u0101s\u012b, \u015b\u016bdra kene nayayei k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-tattva-vett\u0101, sei \u2018guru\u2019 haya\u201cIt does not matter whether a person is a vipra [learned scholar in Vedic wisdom], or is born in a lower family, or is in the renounced order of life \u2013 if he is a master in the science of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, he is the perfect and bona fide spiritual master.\u201d (Caitanya-carit\u0101m\u1e5bta, Madhya 8.128) So without being a master in the science of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, no one is a bona fide spiritual master. It is also said in the Vedic literature:\u1e63a\u1e6d-karma-nipu\u1e47o vipromantra-tantra-vi\u015b\u0101rada\u1e25avai\u1e63\u1e47avo gurur na sy\u0101dvai\u1e63\u1e47ava\u1e25 \u015bva-paco guru\u1e25\u201cA scholarly br\u0101hma\u1e47a, expert in all subjects of Vedic knowledge, is unfit to become a spiritual master without being a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava, or expert in the science of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. But a person born in a family of a lower caste can become a spiritual master if he is a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava, or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious.\u201d (Padma Pur\u0101\u1e47a)The problems of material existence \u2013 birth, old age, disease and death \u2013 cannot be counteracted by accumulation of wealth and economic development. In many parts of the world there are states which are replete with all facilities of life, which are full of wealth and economically developed, yet the problems of material existence are still present. They are seeking peace in different ways, but they can achieve real happiness only if they consult K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, or the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 and \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam \u2013 which constitute the science of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a \u2013 through the bona fide representative of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the man in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.If economic development and material comforts could drive away one\u2019s lamentations for family, social, national or international inebrieties, then Arjuna would not have said that even an unrivaled kingdom on earth or supremacy like that of the demigods in the heavenly planets would be unable to drive away his lamentations. He sought, therefore, refuge in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, and that is the right path for peace and harmony. Economic development or supremacy over the world can be finished at any moment by the cataclysms of material nature. Even elevation into a higher planetary situation, as men are now seeking on the moon planet, can also be finished at one stroke. The Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 confirms this: k\u1e63\u012b\u1e47e pu\u1e47ye martya-loka\u1e41 vi\u015banti. \u201cWhen the results of pious activities are finished, one falls down again from the peak of happiness to the lowest status of life.\u201d Many politicians of the world have fallen down in that way. Such downfalls only constitute more causes for lamentation.Therefore, if we want to curb lamentation for good, then we have to take shelter of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, as Arjuna is seeking to do. So Arjuna asked K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to solve his problem definitely, and that is the way of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness."}
