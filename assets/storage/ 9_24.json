Therefore, those who do not recognize My true transcendental nature fall down.PurportHere it is clearly stated that there are many types of yaj\u00f1a performances recommended in the Vedic literatures, but actually all of them are meant for satisfying the Supreme Lord. Yaj\u00f1a means Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. In the Third Chapter of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 it is clearly stated that one should only work for satisfying Yaj\u00f1a, or Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. The perfectional form of human civilization, known as var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama-dharma, is specifically meant for satisfying Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. Therefore, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says in this verse, \u201cI am the enjoyer of all sacrifices because I am the supreme master.\u201d Less intelligent persons, however, without knowing this fact, worship demigods for temporary benefit. Therefore they fall down to material existence and do not achieve the desired goal of life. If, however, anyone has any material desire to be fulfilled, he had better pray for it to the Supreme Lord (although that is not pure devotion), and he will thus achieve the desired result."}
