You are its worshipable chief, the supreme spiritual master. No one is greater than You, nor can anyone be one with You. How then could there be anyone greater than You within the three worlds, O Lord of immeasurable power?You are the father of this complete cosmic manifestation, of the moving and the nonmoving. You are its worshipable chief, the supreme spiritual master. No one is greater than You, nor can anyone be one with You. How then could there be anyone greater than You within the three worlds, O Lord of immeasurable power?PurportThe Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, is worshipable as a father is worshipable for his son. He is the spiritual master because He originally gave the Vedic instructions to Brahm\u0101 and presently He is also instructing Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 to Arjuna; therefore He is the original spiritual master, and any bona fide spiritual master at the present moment must be a descendant in the line of disciplic succession stemming from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Without being a representative of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, one cannot become a teacher or spiritual master of transcendental subject matter.The Lord is being paid obeisances in all respects. He is of immeasurable greatness. No one can be greater than the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, because no one is equal to or higher than K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a within any manifestation, spiritual or material. Everyone is below Him. No one can excel Him. This is stated in the \u015avet\u0101\u015bvatara Upani\u1e63ad (6.8):na tasya k\u0101rya\u1e41 kara\u1e47a\u1e41 ca vidyatena tat-sama\u015b c\u0101bhyadhika\u015b ca d\u1e5b\u015byateThe Supreme Lord, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, has senses and a body like the ordinary man, but for Him there is no difference between His senses, His body, His mind and Himself. Foolish persons who do not perfectly know Him say that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is different from His soul, mind, heart and everything else. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is absolute; therefore His activities and potencies are supreme. It is also stated that although He does not have senses like ours, He can perform all sensory activities; therefore His senses are neither imperfect nor limited. No one can be greater than Him, no one can be equal to Him, and everyone is lower than Him.The knowledge, strength and activities of the Supreme Personality are all transcendental. As stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (4.9):janma karma ca me divyameva\u1e41 yo vetti tattvata\u1e25tyaktv\u0101 deha\u1e41 punar janmanaiti m\u0101m eti so \u2019rjunaWhoever knows K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s transcendental body, activities and perfection, after quitting his body, returns to Him and doesn\u2019t come back again to this miserable world. Therefore one should know that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s activities are different from others. The best policy is to follow the principles of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a; that will make one perfect. It is also stated that there is no one who is master of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a; everyone is His servant. The Caitanya-carit\u0101m\u1e5bta (\u0100di 5.142) confirms, ekale \u012b\u015bvara k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, \u0101ra saba bh\u1e5btya: only K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is God, and everyone else is His servant. Everyone is complying with His order. There is no one who can deny His order. Everyone is acting according to His direction, being under His superintendence. As stated in the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101, He is the cause of all causes."}
