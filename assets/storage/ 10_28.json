Of causes for procreation I am Kandarpa, the god of love, and of serpents I am V\u0101suki.PurportThe thunderbolt, indeed a mighty weapon, represents K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s power. In K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47aloka in the spiritual sky there are cows which can be milked at any time, and they give as much milk as one likes. Of course such cows do not exist in this material world, but there is mention of them in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47aloka. The Lord keeps many such cows, which are called surabhi. It is stated that the Lord is engaged in herding the surabhi cows. Kandarpa is the sex desire for presenting good sons; therefore Kandarpa is the representative of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Sometimes sex is engaged in only for sense gratification; such sex does not represent K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. But sex for the generation of good children is called Kandarpa and represents K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a."}
