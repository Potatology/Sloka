Neither the demigods nor the demons, O Lord, can understand Your personality.O K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, I totally accept as truth all that You have told me. Neither the demigods nor the demons, O Lord, can understand Your personality.PurportArjuna herein confirms that persons of faithless and demonic nature cannot understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. He is not known even by the demigods, so what to speak of the so-called scholars of this modern world? By the grace of the Supreme Lord, Arjuna has understood that the Supreme Truth is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and that He is the perfect one. One should therefore follow the path of Arjuna. He received the authority of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. As described in the Fourth Chapter, the parampar\u0101 system of disciplic succession for the understanding of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 was lost, and therefore K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a reestablished that disciplic succession with Arjuna because He considered Arjuna His intimate friend and a great devotee. Therefore, as stated in our Introduction to G\u012btopani\u1e63ad, Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 should be understood in the parampar\u0101 system. When the parampar\u0101 system was lost, Arjuna was selected to rejuvenate it. The acceptance by Arjuna of all that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says should be emulated; then we can understand the essence of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, and then only can we understand that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead."}
