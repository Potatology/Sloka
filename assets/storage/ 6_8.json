Only when one becomes spiritually saturated by transcendental service to the Lord are the transcendental name, form, quality and pastimes of the Lord revealed to him.\u201d (Bhakti-ras\u0101m\u1e5bta-sindhu 1.2.234)This Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is the science of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. No one can become K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious simply by mundane scholarship. One must be fortunate enough to associate with a person who is in pure consciousness. A K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person has realized knowledge, by the grace of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, because he is satisfied with pure devotional service. By realized knowledge, one becomes perfect. By transcendental knowledge one can remain steady in his convictions, but by mere academic knowledge one can be easily deluded and confused by apparent contradictions. It is the realized soul who is actually self-controlled, because he is surrendered to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. He is transcendental because he has nothing to do with mundane scholarship. For him mundane scholarship and mental speculation, which may be as good as gold to others, are of no greater value than pebbles or stones."}
