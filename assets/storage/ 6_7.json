To such a man happiness and distress, heat and cold, honor and dishonor are all the same.PurportActually, every living entity is intended to abide by the dictation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is seated in everyone\u2019s heart as Param\u0101tm\u0101. When the mind is misled by the external, illusory energy, one becomes entangled in material activities. Therefore, as soon as one\u2019s mind is controlled through one of the yoga systems, one should be considered to have already reached the destination. One has to abide by superior dictation. When one\u2019s mind is fixed on the superior nature, he has no alternative but to follow the dictation of the Supreme. The mind must admit some superior dictation and follow it. The effect of controlling the mind is that one automatically follows the dictation of the Param\u0101tm\u0101, or Supersoul. Because this transcendental position is at once achieved by one who is in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, the devotee of the Lord is unaffected by the dualities of material existence, namely distress and happiness, cold and heat, etc. This state is practical sam\u0101dhi, or absorption in the Supreme."}
