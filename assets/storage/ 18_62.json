By His grace you will attain transcendental peace and the supreme and eternal abode.O scion of Bharata, surrender unto Him utterly. By His grace you will attain transcendental peace and the supreme and eternal abode.PurportA living entity should therefore surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is situated in everyone\u2019s heart, and that will relieve him from all kinds of miseries of this material existence. By such surrender, not only will one be released from all miseries in this life, but at the end he will reach the Supreme God. The transcendental world is described in the Vedic literature (\u1e5ag Veda 1.22.20) as tad vi\u1e63\u1e47o\u1e25 parama\u1e41 padam. Since all of creation is the kingdom of God, everything material is actually spiritual, but parama\u1e41 padam specifically refers to the eternal abode, which is called the spiritual sky or Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha.In the Fifteenth Chapter of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 it is stated, sarvasya c\u0101ha\u1e41 h\u1e5bdi sannivi\u1e63\u1e6da\u1e25: the Lord is seated in everyone\u2019s heart. So this recommendation that one should surrender unto the Supersoul sitting within means that one should surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a has already been accepted by Arjuna as the Supreme. He was accepted in the Tenth Chapter as para\u1e41 brahma para\u1e41 dh\u0101ma. Arjuna has accepted K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as the Supreme Personality of Godhead and the supreme abode of all living entities, not only because of his personal experience but also because of the evidence of great authorities like N\u0101rada, Asita, Devala and Vy\u0101sa."}
