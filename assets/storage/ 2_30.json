Therefore you need not grieve for any living being.PurportThe Lord now concludes the chapter of instruction on the immutable spirit soul. In describing the immortal soul in various ways, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a establishes that the soul is immortal and the body is temporary. Therefore Arjuna as a k\u1e63atriya should not abandon his duty out of fear that his grandfather and teacher \u2013 Bh\u012b\u1e63ma and Dro\u1e47a \u2013 will die in the battle. On the authority of \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, one has to believe that there is a soul different from the material body, not that there is no such thing as soul, or that living symptoms develop at a certain stage of material maturity resulting from the interaction of chemicals. Though the soul is immortal, violence is not encouraged, but at the time of war it is not discouraged when there is actual need for it. That need must be justified in terms of the sanction of the Lord, and not capriciously."}
