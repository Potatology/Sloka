Destruction in the course of performing one\u2019s own duty is better than engaging in another\u2019s duties, for to follow another\u2019s path is dangerous.PurportOne should therefore discharge his prescribed duties in full K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness rather than those prescribed for others. Materially, prescribed duties are duties enjoined according to one\u2019s psychophysical condition, under the spell of the modes of material nature. Spiritual duties are as ordered by the spiritual master for the transcendental service of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. But whether material or spiritual, one should stick to his prescribed duties even up to death, rather than imitate another\u2019s prescribed duties. Duties on the spiritual platform and duties on the material platform may be different, but the principle of following the authorized direction is always good for the performer. When one is under the spell of the modes of material nature, one should follow the prescribed rules for his particular situation and should not imitate others. For example, a br\u0101hma\u1e47a, who is in the mode of goodness, is nonviolent, whereas a k\u1e63atriya, who is in the mode of passion, is allowed to be violent. As such, for a k\u1e63atriya it is better to be vanquished following the rules of violence than to imitate a br\u0101hma\u1e47a who follows the principles of nonviolence. Everyone has to cleanse his heart by a gradual process, not abruptly. However, when one transcends the modes of material nature and is fully situated in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, he can perform anything and everything under the direction of a bona fide spiritual master. In that complete stage of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, the k\u1e63atriya may act as a br\u0101hma\u1e47a, or a br\u0101hma\u1e47a may act as a k\u1e63atriya. In the transcendental stage, the distinctions of the material world do not apply. For example, Vi\u015bv\u0101mitra was originally a k\u1e63atriya, but later on he acted as a br\u0101hma\u1e47a, whereas Para\u015bur\u0101ma was a br\u0101hma\u1e47a but later on he acted as a k\u1e63atriya. Being transcendentally situated, they could do so; but as long as one is on the material platform, he must perform his duties according to the modes of material nature. At the same time, he must have a full sense of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness."}
