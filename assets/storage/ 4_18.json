His activities are all performed for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a; therefore he does not enjoy or suffer any of the effects of work. Consequently he is intelligent in human society, even though he is engaged in all sorts of activities for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Akarma means without reaction to work. The impersonalist ceases fruitive activities out of fear, so that the resultant action may not be a stumbling block on the path of self-realization, but the personalist knows rightly his position as the eternal servitor of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore he engages himself in the activities of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Because everything is done for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, he enjoys only transcendental happiness in the discharge of this service. Those who are engaged in this process are known to be without desire for personal sense gratification. The sense of eternal servitorship to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a makes one immune to all sorts of reactionary elements of work."}
