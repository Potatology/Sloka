To be free from material contamination, a pure devotee acts under the direction of the Supreme Lord or His representative, the spiritual master. There is no time limitation for a pure devotee. He is always, twenty-four hours a day, one hundred percent engaged in activities under the direction of the Supreme Lord. To a devotee who is thus engaged in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness the Lord is very, very kind. In spite of all difficulties, he is eventually placed in the transcendental abode, or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47aloka. He is guaranteed entrance there; there is no doubt about it. In that supreme abode, there is no change; everything is eternal, imperishable and full of knowledge."}
