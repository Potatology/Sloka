One\u2019s memory of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is revived by chanting the mah\u0101-mantra, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. By this practice of chanting and hearing the sound vibration of the Supreme Lord, one\u2019s ear, tongue and mind are engaged. This mystic meditation is very easy to practice, and it helps one attain the Supreme Lord. Puru\u1e63am means enjoyer. Although living entities belong to the marginal energy of the Supreme Lord, they are in material contamination. They think themselves enjoyers, but they are not the supreme enjoyer. Here it is clearly stated that the supreme enjoyer is the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His different manifestations and plenary expansions as N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, V\u0101sudeva, etc.The devotee can constantly think of the object of worship, the Supreme Lord, in any of His features \u2013 N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, R\u0101ma, etc. \u2013 by chanting Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. This practice will purify him, and at the end of his life, due to his constant chanting, he will be transferred to the kingdom of God. Yoga practice is meditation on the Supersoul within; similarly, by chanting Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a one fixes his mind always on the Supreme Lord. The mind is fickle, and therefore it is necessary to engage the mind by force to think of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. One example often given is that of the caterpillar that thinks of becoming a butterfly and so is transformed into a butterfly in the same life. Similarly, if we constantly think of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, it is certain that at the end of our lives we shall have the same bodily constitution as K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a."}
