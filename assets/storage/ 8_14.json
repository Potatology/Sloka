Previous verses have mentioned four different kinds of devotees \u2013 the distressed, the inquisitive, those who seek material gain, and the speculative philosophers. Different processes of liberation have also been described: karma-yoga, j\u00f1\u0101na-yoga and ha\u1e6dha-yoga. The principles of these yoga systems have some bhakti added, but this verse particularly mentions pure bhakti-yoga, without any mixture of j\u00f1\u0101na, karma or ha\u1e6dha. As indicated by the word ananya-cet\u0101\u1e25, in pure bhakti-yoga the devotee desires nothing but K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. A pure devotee does not desire promotion to heavenly planets, nor does he seek oneness with the brahma-jyotir or salvation or liberation from material entanglement. A pure devotee does not desire anything. In the Caitanya-carit\u0101m\u1e5bta the pure devotee is called ni\u1e63k\u0101ma, which means he has no desire for self-interest. Perfect peace belongs to him alone, not to them who strive for personal gain. Whereas a j\u00f1\u0101na-yog\u012b, karma-yog\u012b or ha\u1e6dha-yog\u012b has his own selfish interests, a perfect devotee has no desire other than to please the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore the Lord says that for anyone who is unflinchingly devoted to Him, He is easy to attain.A pure devotee always engages in devotional service to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in one of His various personal features. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a has various plenary expansions and incarnations, such as R\u0101ma and N\u1e5bsi\u1e41ha, and a devotee can choose to fix his mind in loving service to any of these transcendental forms of the Supreme Lord. Such a devotee meets with none of the problems that plague the practitioners of other yogas. Bhakti-yoga is very simple and pure and easy to perform. One can begin simply by chanting Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The Lord is merciful to all, but as we have already explained, He is especially inclined toward those who always serve Him without deviation. The Lord helps such devotees in various ways. As stated in the Vedas (Ka\u1e6dha Upani\u1e63ad 1.2.23), yam evai\u1e63a v\u1e5b\u1e47ute tena labhyas/ tasyai\u1e63a \u0101tm\u0101 viv\u1e5b\u1e47ute tanu\u1e41 sv\u0101m: one who is fully surrendered and engaged in the devotional service of the Supreme Lord can understand the Supreme Lord as He is. And as stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (10.10), dad\u0101mi buddhi-yoga\u1e41 tam: the Lord gives such a devotee sufficient intelligence so that ultimately the devotee can attain Him in His spiritual kingdom.The special qualification of the pure devotee is that he is always thinking of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a without deviation and without considering the time or place. There should be no impediments. He should be able to carry out his service anywhere and at any time. Some say that the devotee should remain in holy places like V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana or some holy town where the Lord lived, but a pure devotee can live anywhere and create the atmosphere of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana by his devotional service. It was \u015ar\u012b Advaita who told Lord Caitanya, \u201cWherever You are, O Lord \u2013 there is V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana.\u201dAs indicated by the words satatam and nitya\u015ba\u1e25, which mean \u201calways,\u201d \u201cregularly,\u201d or \u201cevery day,\u201d a pure devotee constantly remembers K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and meditates upon Him. These are qualifications of the pure devotee, for whom the Lord is most easily attainable. Bhakti-yoga is the system that the G\u012bt\u0101 recommends above all others. Generally, the bhakti-yog\u012bs are engaged in five different ways: (1) \u015b\u0101nta-bhakta, engaged in devotional service in neutrality; (2) d\u0101sya-bhakta, engaged in devotional service as servant; (3) sakhya-bhakta, engaged as friend; (4) v\u0101tsalya-bhakta, engaged as parent; and (5) m\u0101dhurya-bhakta, engaged as conjugal lover of the Supreme Lord. In any of these ways, the pure devotee is always constantly engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Supreme Lord and cannot forget the Supreme Lord, and so for him the Lord is easily attained. A pure devotee cannot forget the Supreme Lord for a moment, and similarly the Supreme Lord cannot forget His pure devotee for a moment. This is the great blessing of the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious process of chanting the mah\u0101-mantra \u2013 Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare."}
