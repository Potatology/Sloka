In pure devotional service one comes to the realization that God is great and that the individual soul is subordinate to Him. His duty is to render service to the Lord \u2013 and if he does not, then he will render service to m\u0101y\u0101.As stated before, the Supreme Lord can be appreciated only by devotional service. Therefore, one should be fully devoted. One should fix his mind fully on K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in order to achieve Him. One should work only for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. It does not matter in what kind of work one engages, but that work should be done only for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. That is the standard of devotional service. The devotee does not desire any achievement other than pleasing the Supreme Personality of Godhead. His life\u2019s mission is to please K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and he can sacrifice everything for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s satisfaction, just as Arjuna did in the Battle of Kuruk\u1e63etra. The process is very simple: one can devote himself in his occupation and engage at the same time in chanting Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare. Such transcendental chanting attracts the devotee to the Personality of Godhead.The Supreme Lord herein promises that without delay He will deliver a pure devotee thus engaged from the ocean of material existence. Those who are advanced in yoga practice can willfully transfer the soul to whatever planet they like by the yoga process, and others take the opportunity in various ways, but as far as the devotee is concerned, it is clearly stated here that the Lord Himself takes him. The devotee does not need to wait to become very experienced in order to transfer himself to the spiritual sky.In the Var\u0101ha Pur\u0101\u1e47a this verse appears:nay\u0101mi parama\u1e41 sth\u0101namarcir-\u0101di-gati\u1e41 vin\u0101garu\u1e0da-skandham \u0101ropyayatheccham aniv\u0101rita\u1e25The purport of this verse is that a devotee does not need to practice a\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101\u1e45ga-yoga in order to transfer his soul to the spiritual planets. The responsibility is taken by the Supreme Lord Himself. He clearly states here that He Himself becomes the deliverer. A child is completely cared for by his parents, and thus his position is secure. Similarly, a devotee does not need to endeavor to transfer himself by yoga practice to other planets. Rather, the Supreme Lord, by His great mercy, comes at once, riding on His bird carrier Garu\u1e0da, and at once delivers the devotee from material existence. Although a man who has fallen in the ocean may struggle very hard and may be very expert in swimming, he cannot save himself. But if someone comes and picks him up from the water, then he is easily rescued. Similarly, the Lord picks up the devotee from this material existence. One simply has to practice the easy process of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and fully engage himself in devotional service. Any intelligent man should always prefer the process of devotional service to all other paths. In the N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47\u012bya this is confirmed as follows:y\u0101 vai s\u0101dhana-sampatti\u1e25puru\u1e63\u0101rtha-catu\u1e63\u1e6dayetay\u0101 vin\u0101 tad \u0101pnotinaro n\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47\u0101\u015braya\u1e25The purport of this verse is that one should not engage in the different processes of fruitive activity or cultivate knowledge by the mental speculative process. One who is devoted to the Supreme Personality can attain all the benefits derived from other yogic processes, speculation, rituals, sacrifices, charities, etc. That is the specific benediction of devotional service.Simply by chanting the holy name of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a \u2013 Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare \u2013 a devotee of the Lord can approach the supreme destination easily and happily, but this destination cannot be approached by any other process of religion.The conclusion of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is stated in the Eighteenth Chapter:sarva-dharm\u0101n parityajyam\u0101m eka\u1e41 \u015bara\u1e47a\u1e41 vrajaaha\u1e41 tv\u0101\u1e41 sarva-p\u0101pebhyomok\u1e63ayi\u1e63y\u0101mi m\u0101 \u015buca\u1e25One should give up all other processes of self-realization and simply execute devotional service in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. That will enable one to reach the highest perfection of life. There is no need for one to consider the sinful actions of his past life, because the Supreme Lord fully takes charge of him. Therefore one should not futilely try to deliver himself in spiritual realization. Let everyone take shelter of the supreme omnipotent Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. That is the highest perfection of life."}
