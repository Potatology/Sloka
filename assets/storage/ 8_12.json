Closing all the doors of the senses and fixing the mind on the heart and the life air at the top of the head, one establishes himself in yoga.PurportTo practice yoga as suggested here, one first has to close the doors of all sense enjoyment. This practice is called praty\u0101h\u0101ra, or withdrawing the senses from the sense objects. The sense organs for acquiring knowledge \u2013 the eyes, ears, nose, tongue and touch \u2013 should be fully controlled and should not be allowed to engage in self-gratification. In this way the mind focuses on the Supersoul in the heart, and the life force is raised to the top of the head. In the Sixth Chapter this process is described in detail. But as mentioned before, this practice is not practical in this age. The best process is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. If one is always able to fix his mind on K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in devotional service, it is very easy for him to remain in an undisturbed transcendental trance, or in sam\u0101dhi."}
