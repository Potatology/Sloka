He is satisfied with gains which are obtained of their own accord. He neither begs nor borrows, but he labors honestly as far as is in his power, and is satisfied with whatever is obtained by his own honest labor. He is therefore independent in his livelihood. He does not allow anyone\u2019s service to hamper his own service in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. However, for the service of the Lord he can participate in any kind of action without being disturbed by the duality of the material world. The duality of the material world is felt in terms of heat and cold, or misery and happiness. A K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person is above duality because he does not hesitate to act in any way for the satisfaction of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Therefore he is steady both in success and in failure. These signs are visible when one is fully in transcendental knowledge."}
