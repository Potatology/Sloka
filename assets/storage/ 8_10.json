For those practiced in yoga, it is recommended that they raise the life force between the eyebrows (to the \u0101j\u00f1\u0101-cakra). The practice of \u1e63a\u1e6d-cakra-yoga, involving meditation on the six cakras, is suggested here. A pure devotee does not practice such yoga, but because he is always engaged in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, at death he can remember the Supreme Personality of Godhead by His grace. This is explained in verse 14.The particular use of the word yoga-balena is significant in this verse because without practice of yoga \u2013 whether \u1e63a\u1e6d-cakra-yoga or bhakti-yoga \u2013 one cannot come to this transcendental state of being at the time of death. One cannot suddenly remember the Supreme Lord at death; one must have practiced some yoga system, especially the system of bhakti-yoga. Since one\u2019s mind at death is very disturbed, one should practice transcendence through yoga during one\u2019s life."}
