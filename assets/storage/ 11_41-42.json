He is admitting that formerly he did not know that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a could assume such a universal form, although K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a explained it as his intimate friend. Arjuna did not know how many times he may have dishonored K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a by addressing Him \u201cO my friend,\u201d \u201cO K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a,\u201d \u201cO Y\u0101dava,\u201d etc., without acknowledging His opulence. But K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is so kind and merciful that in spite of such opulence He played with Arjuna as a friend. Such is the transcendental loving reciprocation between the devotee and the Lord. The relationship between the living entity and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is fixed eternally; it cannot be forgotten, as we can see from the behavior of Arjuna. Although Arjuna has seen the opulence in the universal form, he cannot forget his friendly relationship with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a."}
