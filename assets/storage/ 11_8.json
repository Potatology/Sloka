Behold My mystic opulence!PurportA pure devotee does not like to see K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in any form except His form with two hands; a devotee must see His universal form by His grace, not with the mind but with spiritual eyes. To see the universal form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Arjuna is told not to change his mind but his vision. The universal form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is not very important; that will be clear in subsequent verses. Yet because Arjuna wanted to see it, the Lord gives him the particular vision required to see that universal form.Devotees who are correctly situated in a transcendental relationship with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a are attracted by loving features, not by a godless display of opulences. The playmates of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the friends of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and the parents of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a never want K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to show His opulences. They are so immersed in pure love that they do not even know that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In their loving exchange they forget that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Lord. In the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam it is stated that the boys who play with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a are all highly pious souls, and after many, many births they are able to play with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Such boys do not know that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. They take Him as a personal friend. Therefore \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b recites this verse:ittha\u1e41 sat\u0101\u1e41 brahma-sukh\u0101nubh\u016bty\u0101d\u0101sya\u1e41 gat\u0101n\u0101\u1e41 para-daivatenam\u0101y\u0101\u015brit\u0101n\u0101\u1e41 nara-d\u0101rake\u1e47as\u0101ka\u1e41 vijahru\u1e25 k\u1e5bta-pu\u1e47ya-pu\u00f1j\u0101\u1e25\u201cHere is the Supreme Person, who is considered the impersonal Brahman by great sages, the Supreme Personality of Godhead by devotees, and a product of material nature by ordinary men. Now these boys, who have performed many, many pious activities in their past lives, are playing with that Supreme Personality of Godhead.\u201d (\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam 10.12.11)The fact is that the devotee is not concerned with seeing the vi\u015bva-r\u016bpa, the universal form, but Arjuna wanted to see it to substantiate K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s statements so that in the future people could understand that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a not only theoretically or philosophically presented Himself as the Supreme but actually presented Himself as such to Arjuna. Arjuna must confirm this because Arjuna is the beginning of the parampar\u0101 system. Those who are actually interested in understanding the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and who follow in the footsteps of Arjuna should understand that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a not only theoretically presented Himself as the Supreme, but actually revealed Himself as the Supreme.The Lord gave Arjuna the necessary power to see His universal form because He knew that Arjuna did not particularly want to see it, as we have already explained."}
