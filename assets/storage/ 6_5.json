The mind is the friend of the conditioned soul, and his enemy as well.PurportThe word \u0101tm\u0101 denotes body, mind and soul \u2013 depending upon different circumstances. In the yoga system, the mind and the conditioned soul are especially important. Since the mind is the central point of yoga practice, \u0101tm\u0101 refers here to the mind. The purpose of the yoga system is to control the mind and to draw it away from attachment to sense objects. It is stressed herein that the mind must be so trained that it can deliver the conditioned soul from the mire of nescience. In material existence one is subjected to the influence of the mind and the senses. In fact, the pure soul is entangled in the material world because the mind is involved with the false ego, which desires to lord it over material nature. Therefore, the mind should be trained so that it will not be attracted by the glitter of material nature, and in this way the conditioned soul may be saved. One should not degrade oneself by attraction to sense objects. The more one is attracted by sense objects, the more one becomes entangled in material existence. The best way to disentangle oneself is to always engage the mind in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. The word hi is used for emphasizing this point, i.e., that one must do this. It is also said:mana eva manu\u1e63y\u0101\u1e47\u0101\u1e41k\u0101ra\u1e47a\u1e41 bandha-mok\u1e63ayo\u1e25bandh\u0101ya vi\u1e63ay\u0101sa\u1e45gomuktyai nirvi\u1e63aya\u1e41 mana\u1e25\u201cFor man, mind is the cause of bondage and mind is the cause of liberation. Mind absorbed in sense objects is the cause of bondage, and mind detached from the sense objects is the cause of liberation.\u201d (Am\u1e5bta-bindu Upani\u1e63ad 2) Therefore, the mind which is always engaged in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is the cause of supreme liberation."}
