It is not by these means that one can see Me as I am.PurportK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a first appeared before His parents Devak\u012b and Vasudeva in a four-handed form, and then He transformed Himself into the two-handed form. This mystery is very difficult to understand for those who are atheists or who are devoid of devotional service. For scholars who have simply studied Vedic literature by way of grammatical knowledge or mere academic qualifications, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is not possible to understand. Nor is He to be understood by persons who officially go to the temple to offer worship. They make their visit, but they cannot understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as He is. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a can be understood only through the path of devotional service, as explained by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself in the next verse."}
