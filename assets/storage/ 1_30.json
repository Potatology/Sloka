Excessive attachment for material things puts a man in such a bewildering condition of existence. Bhaya\u1e41 dvit\u012by\u0101bhinive\u015bata\u1e25 sy\u0101t (Bh\u0101g. 11.2.37): such fearfulness and loss of mental equilibrium take place in persons who are too affected by material conditions. Arjuna envisioned only painful reverses in the battlefield \u2013 he would not be happy even by gaining victory over the foe. The words nimitt\u0101ni vipar\u012bt\u0101ni are significant. When a man sees only frustration in his expectations, he thinks, \u201cWhy am I here?\u201d Everyone is interested in himself and his own welfare. No one is interested in the Supreme Self. Arjuna is showing ignorance of his real self-interest by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s will. One\u2019s real self-interest lies in Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The conditioned soul forgets this, and therefore suffers material pains. Arjuna thought that his victory in the battle would only be a cause of lamentation for him."}
