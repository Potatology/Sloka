It is called asat and is useless both in this life and the next.PurportAnything done without the transcendental objective \u2013 whether it be sacrifice, charity or penance \u2013 is useless. Therefore in this verse it is declared that such activities are abominable. Everything should be done for the Supreme in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Without such faith, and without the proper guidance, there can never be any fruit. In all the Vedic scriptures, faith in the Supreme is advised. In the pursuit of all Vedic instructions, the ultimate goal is the understanding of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. No one can obtain success without following this principle. Therefore, the best course is to work from the very beginning in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness under the guidance of a bona fide spiritual master. That is the way to make everything successful.In the conditional state, people are attracted to worshiping demigods, ghosts, or Yak\u1e63as like Kuvera. The mode of goodness is better than the modes of passion and ignorance, but one who takes directly to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is transcendental to all three modes of material nature. Although there is a process of gradual elevation, if one, by the association of pure devotees, takes directly to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, that is the best way. And that is recommended in this chapter. To achieve success in this way, one must first find the proper spiritual master and receive training under his direction. Then one can achieve faith in the Supreme. When that faith matures, in course of time, it is called love of God. This love is the ultimate goal of the living entities. One should therefore take to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness directly. That is the message of this Seventeenth Chapter.Thus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Seventeenth Chapter of the \u015ar\u012bmad Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 in the matter of the Divisions of Faith."}
