There are no material reactions resulting from the activities of a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person. Therefore purified activities, which are generally called sad-\u0101c\u0101ra, can be easily performed by acting in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. \u015ar\u012b R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b in his Bhakti-ras\u0101m\u1e5bta-sindhu (1.2.187) describes this as follows:\u012bh\u0101 yasya harer d\u0101syekarma\u1e47\u0101 manas\u0101 gir\u0101nikhil\u0101sv apy avasth\u0101suj\u012bvan-mukta\u1e25 sa ucyate\u201cA person acting in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness (or, in other words, in the service of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a) with his body, mind, intelligence and words is a liberated person even within the material world, although he may be engaged in many so-called material activities.\u201d He has no false ego, for he does not believe that he is this material body, or that he possesses the body. He knows that he is not this body and that this body does not belong to him. He himself belongs to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and the body too belongs to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.
