In the material conception of life there are such divisions, but for a person engaged in transcendental devotional service to the Lord there are not. Everyone is eligible for the supreme destination. In the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (2.4.18) it is stated that even the lowest, who are called ca\u1e47\u1e0d\u0101las (dog-eaters), can be purified by association with a pure devotee. Therefore devotional service and the guidance of a pure devotee are so strong that there is no discrimination between the lower and higher classes of men; anyone can take to it. The most simple man taking shelter of the pure devotee can be purified by proper guidance. According to the different modes of material nature, men are classified in the mode of goodness (br\u0101hma\u1e47as), the mode of passion (k\u1e63atriyas, or administrators), the mixed modes of passion and ignorance (vai\u015byas, or merchants), and the mode of ignorance (\u015b\u016bdras, or workers). Those lower than them are called ca\u1e47\u1e0d\u0101las, and they are born in sinful families. Generally, the association of those born in sinful families is not accepted by the higher classes. But the process of devotional service is so strong that the pure devotee of the Supreme Lord can enable people of all the lower classes to attain the highest perfection of life. This is possible only when one takes shelter of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. As indicated here by the word vyap\u0101\u015britya, one has to take shelter completely of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Then one can become much greater than great j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs and yog\u012bs."}
