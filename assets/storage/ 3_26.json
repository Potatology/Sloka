That is the end of all Vedic rituals. All rituals, all performances of sacrifices, and everything that is put into the Vedas, including all direction for material activities, are meant for understanding K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who is the ultimate goal of life. But because the conditioned souls do not know anything beyond sense gratification, they study the Vedas to that end. But through fruitive activities and sense gratification regulated by the Vedic rituals one is gradually elevated to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Therefore a realized soul in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness should not disturb others in their activities or understanding, but he should act by showing how the results of all work can be dedicated to the service of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The learned K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person may act in such a way that the ignorant person working for sense gratification may learn how to act and how to behave. Although the ignorant man is not to be disturbed in his activities, a slightly developed K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person may directly be engaged in the service of the Lord without waiting for other Vedic formulas. For this fortunate man there is no need to follow the Vedic rituals, because by direct K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness one can have all the results one would otherwise derive from following one\u2019s prescribed duties."}
