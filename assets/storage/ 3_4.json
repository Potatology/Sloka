Without purification, one cannot attain success by abruptly adopting the fourth order of life (sanny\u0101sa). According to the empirical philosophers, simply by adopting sanny\u0101sa, or retiring from fruitive activities, one at once becomes as good as N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a. But Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a does not approve this principle. Without purification of heart, sanny\u0101sa is simply a disturbance to the social order. On the other hand, if someone takes to the transcendental service of the Lord, even without discharging his prescribed duties, whatever he may be able to advance in the cause is accepted by the Lord (buddhi-yoga). Sv-alpam apy asya dharmasya tr\u0101yate mahato bhay\u0101t. Even a slight performance of such a principle enables one to overcome great difficulties."}
