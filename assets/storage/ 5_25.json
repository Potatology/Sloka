When a person is actually in the knowledge that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the fountainhead of everything, then when he acts in that spirit he acts for everyone. The sufferings of humanity are due to forgetfulness of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as the supreme enjoyer, the supreme proprietor and the supreme friend. Therefore, to act to revive this consciousness within the entire human society is the highest welfare work. One cannot be engaged in such first-class welfare work without being liberated in the Supreme. A K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person has no doubt about the supremacy of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. He has no doubt because he is completely freed from all sins. This is the state of divine love.A person engaged only in ministering to the physical welfare of human society cannot factually help anyone. Temporary relief of the external body and the mind is not satisfactory. The real cause of one\u2019s difficulties in the hard struggle for life may be found in one\u2019s forgetfulness of his relationship with the Supreme Lord. When a man is fully conscious of his relationship with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, he is actually a liberated soul, although he may be in the material tabernacle."}
