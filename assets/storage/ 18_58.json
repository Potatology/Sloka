If, however, you do not work in such consciousness but act through false ego, not hearing Me, you will be lost.PurportA person in full K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is not unduly anxious about executing the duties of his existence. The foolish cannot understand this great freedom from all anxiety. For one who acts in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a becomes the most intimate friend. He always looks after His friend\u2019s comfort, and He gives Himself to His friend, who is so devotedly engaged working twenty-four hours a day to please the Lord. Therefore, no one should be carried away by the false ego of the bodily concept of life. One should not falsely think himself independent of the laws of material nature or free to act. He is already under strict material laws. But as soon as he acts in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, he is liberated, free from the material perplexities. One should note very carefully that one who is not active in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is losing himself in the material whirlpool, in the ocean of birth and death. No conditioned soul actually knows what is to be done and what is not to be done, but a person who acts in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is free to act because everything is prompted by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a from within and confirmed by the spiritual master."}
