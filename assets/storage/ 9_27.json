Everyone has to work for maintenance of his body and soul together, and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a recommends herein that one should work for Him. Everyone has to eat something to live; therefore he should accept the remnants of foodstuffs offered to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Any civilized man has to perform some religious ritualistic ceremonies; therefore K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a recommends, \u201cDo it for Me,\u201d and this is called arcana. Everyone has a tendency to give something in charity; K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says, \u201cGive it to Me,\u201d and this means that all surplus money accumulated should be utilized in furthering the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness movement. Nowadays people are very much inclined to the meditational process, which is not practical in this age, but if anyone practices meditating on K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a twenty-four hours a day by chanting the Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a mantra round his beads, he is surely the greatest meditator and the greatest yog\u012b, as substantiated by the Sixth Chapter of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101."}
