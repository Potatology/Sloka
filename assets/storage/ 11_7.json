Even the most advanced scientist cannot see what is going on in other parts of the universe. But a devotee like Arjuna can see everything that exists in any part of the universe. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a gives him the power to see anything he wants to see, past, present and future. Thus by the mercy of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Arjuna is able to see everything."}
