And although I am the creator of this system, you should know that I am yet the nondoer, being unchangeable.PurportThe Lord is the creator of everything. Everything is born of Him, everything is sustained by Him, and everything, after annihilation, rests in Him. He is therefore the creator of the four divisions of the social order, beginning with the intelligent class of men, technically called br\u0101hma\u1e47as due to their being situated in the mode of goodness. Next is the administrative class, technically called the k\u1e63atriyas due to their being situated in the mode of passion. The mercantile men, called the vai\u015byas, are situated in the mixed modes of passion and ignorance, and the \u015b\u016bdras, or laborer class, are situated in the ignorant mode of material nature. In spite of His creating the four divisions of human society, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a does not belong to any of these divisions, because He is not one of the conditioned souls, a section of whom form human society. Human society is similar to any other animal society, but to elevate men from the animal status, the above-mentioned divisions are created by the Lord for the systematic development of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. The tendency of a particular man toward work is determined by the modes of material nature which he has acquired. Such symptoms of life, according to the different modes of material nature, are described in the Eighteenth Chapter of this book. A person in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, however, is above even the br\u0101hma\u1e47as. Although br\u0101hma\u1e47as by quality are supposed to know about Brahman, the Supreme Absolute Truth, most of them approach only the impersonal Brahman manifestation of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. But a man who transcends the limited knowledge of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a and reaches the knowledge of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, becomes a person in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness \u2013 or, in other words, a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness includes knowledge of all different plenary expansions of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, namely R\u0101ma, N\u1e5bsi\u1e41ha, Var\u0101ha, etc. And as K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is transcendental to this system of the four divisions of human society, a person in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is also transcendental to all divisions of human society, whether we consider the divisions of community, nation or species."}
