Those who deride K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as if He were an ordinary person are shown here to be ignorant of His divine nature. If K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is like an ordinary human being, then how is it possible for Him to show the universal form and again to show the four-handed N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a form? So it is very clearly stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 that one who thinks that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is an ordinary person and who misguides the reader by claiming that it is the impersonal Brahman within K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a speaking is doing the greatest injustice. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a has actually shown His universal form and His four-handed Vi\u1e63\u1e47u form. So how can He be an ordinary human being? A pure devotee is not confused by misguiding commentaries on Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 because he knows what is what. The original verses of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 are as clear as the sun; they do not require lamplight from foolish commentators."}
