And how can there be any happiness without peace?One who is not connected with the Supreme [in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness] can have neither transcendental intelligence nor a steady mind, without which there is no possibility of peace. And how can there be any happiness without peace?PurportUnless one is in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, there is no possibility of peace. So it is confirmed in the Fifth Chapter (5.29) that when one understands that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the only enjoyer of all the good results of sacrifice and penance, that He is the proprietor of all universal manifestations, and that He is the real friend of all living entities, then only can one have real peace. Therefore, if one is not in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, there cannot be a final goal for the mind. Disturbance is due to want of an ultimate goal, and when one is certain that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the enjoyer, proprietor and friend of everyone and everything, then one can, with a steady mind, bring about peace. Therefore, one who is engaged without a relationship with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is certainly always in distress and is without peace, however much he may make a show of peace and spiritual advancement in life. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is a self-manifested peaceful condition which can be achieved only in relationship with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a."}
