I am the butter and the fire and the offering.PurportThe Vedic sacrifice known as Jyoti\u1e63\u1e6doma is also K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and He is also the Mah\u0101-yaj\u00f1a mentioned in the sm\u1e5bti. The oblations offered to the Pit\u1e5bloka or the sacrifice performed to please the Pit\u1e5bloka, considered as a kind of drug in the form of clarified butter, is also K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The mantras chanted in this connection are also K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. And many other commodities made with milk products for offering in the sacrifices are also K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The fire is also K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a because fire is one of the five material elements and is therefore claimed as the separated energy of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. In other words, the Vedic sacrifices recommended in the karma-k\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da division of the Vedas are in total also K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Or, in other words, those who are engaged in rendering devotional service unto K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a are to be understood to have performed all the sacrifices recommended in the Vedas."}
