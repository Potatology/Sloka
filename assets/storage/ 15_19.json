He therefore engages himself in full devotional service to Me, O son of Bharata.Whoever knows Me as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, without doubting, is the knower of everything. He therefore engages himself in full devotional service to Me, O son of Bharata.PurportThere are many philosophical speculations about the constitutional position of the living entities and the Supreme Absolute Truth. Now in this verse the Supreme Personality of Godhead clearly explains that anyone who knows Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to be the Supreme Person is actually the knower of everything. The imperfect knower goes on simply speculating about the Absolute Truth, but the perfect knower, without wasting his valuable time, engages directly in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, the devotional service of the Supreme Lord. Throughout the whole of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, this fact is being stressed at every step. And still there are so many stubborn commentators on Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 who consider the Supreme Absolute Truth and the living entities to be one and the same.Vedic knowledge is called \u015bruti, learning by aural reception. One should actually receive the Vedic message from authorities like K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and His representatives. Here K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a distinguishes everything very nicely, and one should hear from this source. Simply to hear like the hogs is not sufficient; one must be able to understand from the authorities. It is not that one should simply speculate academically. One should submissively hear from Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 that these living entities are always subordinate to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Anyone who is able to understand this, according to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, knows the purpose of the Vedas; no one else knows the purpose of the Vedas.The word bhajati is very significant. In many places the word bhajati is expressed in relationship with the service of the Supreme Lord. If a person is engaged in full K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, in the devotional service of the Lord, it is to be understood that he has understood all the Vedic knowledge. In the Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava parampar\u0101 it is said that if one is engaged in the devotional service of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, then there is no need for any other spiritual process for understanding the Supreme Absolute Truth. He has already come to the point, because he is engaged in the devotional service of the Lord. He has ended all preliminary processes of understanding. But if anyone, after speculating for hundreds of thousands of lives, does not come to the point that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead and that one has to surrender there, all his speculation for so many years and lives is a useless waste of time."}
