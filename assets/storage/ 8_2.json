And how can those engaged in devotional service know You at the time of death?Who is the Lord of sacrifice, and how does He live in the body, O Madhus\u016bdana? And how can those engaged in devotional service know You at the time of death?Purport\u201cLord of sacrifice\u201d may refer to either Indra or Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is the chief of the primal demigods, including Brahm\u0101 and \u015aiva, and Indra is the chief of the administrative demigods. Both Indra and Vi\u1e63\u1e47u are worshiped by yaj\u00f1a performances. But here Arjuna asks who is actually the Lord of yaj\u00f1a (sacrifice) and how the Lord is residing within the body of the living entity.Arjuna addresses the Lord as Madhus\u016bdana because K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a once killed a demon named Madhu. Actually these questions, which are of the nature of doubts, should not have arisen in the mind of Arjuna, because Arjuna is a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious devotee. Therefore these doubts are like demons. Since K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is so expert in killing demons, Arjuna here addresses Him as Madhus\u016bdana so that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a might kill the demonic doubts that arise in Arjuna\u2019s mind.Now the word pray\u0101\u1e47a-k\u0101le in this verse is very significant because whatever we do in life will be tested at the time of death. Arjuna is very anxious to know of those who are constantly engaged in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. What should be their position at that final moment? At the time of death all the bodily functions are disrupted, and the mind is not in a proper condition. Thus disturbed by the bodily situation, one may not be able to remember the Supreme Lord. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Kula\u015bekhara, a great devotee, prays, \u201cMy dear Lord, just now I am quite healthy, and it is better that I die immediately so that the swan of my mind can seek entrance at the stem of Your lotus feet.\u201d The metaphor is used because the swan, a bird of the water, takes pleasure in digging into the lotus flowers; its sporting proclivity is to enter the lotus flower. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Kula\u015bekhara says to the Lord, \u201cNow my mind is undisturbed, and I am quite healthy. If I die immediately, thinking of Your lotus feet, then I am sure that my performance of Your devotional service will become perfect. But if I have to wait for my natural death, then I do not know what will happen, because at that time the bodily functions will be disrupted, my throat will be choked up, and I do not know whether I shall be able to chant Your name. Better let me die immediately.\u201d Arjuna questions how a person can fix his mind on K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s lotus feet at such a time."}
