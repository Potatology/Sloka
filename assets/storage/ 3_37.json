Or, in other words, the sense of love of God becomes transformed into lust, as milk in contact with sour tamarind is transformed into yogurt. Then again, when lust is unsatisfied, it turns into wrath; wrath is transformed into illusion, and illusion continues the material existence. Therefore, lust is the greatest enemy of the living entity, and it is lust only which induces the pure living entity to remain entangled in the material world. Wrath is the manifestation of the mode of ignorance; these modes exhibit themselves as wrath and other corollaries. If, therefore, the mode of passion, instead of being degraded into the mode of ignorance, is elevated to the mode of goodness by the prescribed method of living and acting, then one can be saved from the degradation of wrath by spiritual attachment.The Supreme Personality of Godhead expanded Himself into many for His ever-increasing spiritual bliss, and the living entities are parts and parcels of this spiritual bliss. They also have partial independence, but by misuse of their independence, when the service attitude is transformed into the propensity for sense enjoyment, they come under the sway of lust. This material creation is created by the Lord to give facility to the conditioned souls to fulfill these lustful propensities, and when completely baffled by prolonged lustful activities, the living entities begin to inquire about their real position.This inquiry is the beginning of the Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btras, wherein it is said, ath\u0101to brahma-jij\u00f1\u0101s\u0101: one should inquire into the Supreme. And the Supreme is defined in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam as janm\u0101dy asya yato \u2019nvay\u0101d itarata\u015b ca, or, \u201cThe origin of everything is the Supreme Brahman.\u201d Therefore the origin of lust is also in the Supreme. If, therefore, lust is transformed into love for the Supreme, or transformed into K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness \u2013 or, in other words, desiring everything for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a \u2013 then both lust and wrath can be spiritualized. Hanum\u0101n, the great servitor of Lord R\u0101ma, exhibited his wrath by burning the golden city of R\u0101va\u1e47a, but by doing so he became the greatest devotee of the Lord. Here also, in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, the Lord induces Arjuna to engage his wrath upon his enemies for the satisfaction of the Lord. Therefore, lust and wrath, when they are employed in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, become our friends instead of our enemies."}
