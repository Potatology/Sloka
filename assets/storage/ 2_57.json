One who is not agitated by such material upheavals, who is unaffected by good and evil, is to be understood to be fixed in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. As long as one is in the material world there is always the possibility of good and evil because this world is full of duality. But one who is fixed in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is not affected by good and evil, because he is simply concerned with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who is all-good absolute. Such consciousness in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a situates one in a perfect transcendental position called, technically, sam\u0101dhi."}
