All living entities within the material creation are conditioned by material nature because of their forgetfulness of their relationship to Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Vedic principles are to help us understand this eternal relation, as it is stated in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101: vedai\u015b ca sarvair aham eva vedya\u1e25. The Lord says that the purpose of the Vedas is to understand Him. In the Vedic hymns it is said: pati\u1e41 vi\u015bvasy\u0101tme\u015bvaram. Therefore, the Lord of the living entities is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. In the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam also (2.4.20) \u015ar\u012bla \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b describes the Lord as pati in so many ways:\u015briya\u1e25 patir yaj\u00f1a-pati\u1e25 praj\u0101-patirdhiy\u0101\u1e41 patir loka-patir dhar\u0101-pati\u1e25patir gati\u015b c\u0101ndhaka-v\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47i-s\u0101tvat\u0101\u1e41pras\u012bdat\u0101\u1e41 me bhagav\u0101n sat\u0101\u1e41 pati\u1e25The praj\u0101-pati is Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, and He is the Lord of all living creatures, all worlds, and all beauties, and the protector of everyone. The Lord created this material world to enable the conditioned souls to learn how to perform yaj\u00f1as (sacrifices) for the satisfaction of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, so that while in the material world they can live very comfortably without anxiety, and after finishing the present material body they can enter into the kingdom of God. That is the whole program for the conditioned soul. By performance of yaj\u00f1a, the conditioned souls gradually become K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious and become godly in all respects. In the Age of Kali, the sa\u1e45k\u012brtana-yaj\u00f1a (the chanting of the names of God) is recommended by the Vedic scriptures, and this transcendental system was introduced by Lord Caitanya for the deliverance of all men in this age. Sa\u1e45k\u012brtana-yaj\u00f1a and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness go well together. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in His devotional form (as Lord Caitanya) is mentioned in the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (11.5.32) as follows, with special reference to the sa\u1e45k\u012brtana-yaj\u00f1a:k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-var\u1e47a\u1e41 tvi\u1e63\u0101k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u1e41s\u0101\u1e45gop\u0101\u1e45g\u0101stra-p\u0101r\u1e63adamyaj\u00f1ai\u1e25 sa\u1e45k\u012brtana-pr\u0101yairyajanti hi su-medhasa\u1e25\u201cIn this Age of Kali, people who are endowed with sufficient intelligence will worship the Lord, who is accompanied by His associates, by performance of sa\u1e45k\u012brtana-yaj\u00f1a.\u201d Other yaj\u00f1as prescribed in the Vedic literatures are not easy to perform in this Age of Kali, but the sa\u1e45k\u012brtana-yaj\u00f1a is easy and sublime for all purposes, as recommended in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 also (9.14)."}
