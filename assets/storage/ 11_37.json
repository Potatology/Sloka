Why then should they not offer their respectful obeisances unto You? O limitless one, God of gods, refuge of the universe! You are the invincible source, the cause of all causes, transcendental to this material manifestation.PurportBy this offering of obeisances, Arjuna indicates that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is worshipable by everyone. He is all-pervading, and He is the Soul of every soul. Arjuna is addressing K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as mah\u0101tm\u0101, which means that He is most magnanimous and unlimited. Ananta indicates that there is nothing which is not covered by the influence and energy of the Supreme Lord, and deve\u015ba means that He is the controller of all demigods and is above them all. He is the shelter of the whole universe. Arjuna also thought that it was fitting that all the perfect living entities and powerful demigods offer their respectful obeisances unto Him, because no one is greater than Him. Arjuna especially mentions that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is greater than Brahm\u0101 because Brahm\u0101 is created by Him. Brahm\u0101 is born out of the lotus stem grown from the navel abdomen of Garbhodaka-\u015b\u0101y\u012b Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, who is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s plenary expansion; therefore Brahm\u0101 and Lord \u015aiva, who is born of Brahm\u0101, and all other demigods must offer their respectful obeisances. It is stated in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam that the Lord is respected by Lord \u015aiva and Brahm\u0101 and similar other demigods. The word ak\u1e63aram is very significant because this material creation is subject to destruction but the Lord is above this material creation. He is the cause of all causes, and being so, He is superior to all the conditioned souls within this material nature as well as the material cosmic manifestation itself. He is therefore the all-great Supreme."}
