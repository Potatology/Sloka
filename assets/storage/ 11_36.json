Although the perfected beings offer You their respectful homage, the demons are afraid, and they flee here and there. All this is rightly done.PurportArjuna, after hearing from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a about the outcome of the Battle of Kuruk\u1e63etra, became enlightened, and as a great devotee and friend of the Supreme Personality of Godhead he said that everything done by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is quite fit. Arjuna confirmed that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the maintainer and the object of worship for the devotees and the destroyer of the undesirables. His actions are equally good for all. Arjuna understood herein that when the Battle of Kuruk\u1e63etra was being concluded, in outer space there were present many demigods, siddhas, and the intelligentsia of the higher planets, and they were observing the fight because K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was present there. When Arjuna saw the universal form of the Lord, the demigods took pleasure in it, but others, who were demons and atheists, could not stand it when the Lord was praised. Out of their natural fear of the devastating form of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, they fled. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s treatment of the devotees and the atheists is praised by Arjuna. In all cases a devotee glorifies the Lord because he knows that whatever He does is good for all."}
