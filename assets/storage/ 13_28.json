Unless one has the association of a real knower of spiritual subjects, one cannot see these three things. Those who do not have such association are ignorant; they simply see the body, and they think that when the body is destroyed everything is finished. But actually it is not so. After the destruction of the body, both the soul and the Supersoul exist, and they go on eternally in many various moving and nonmoving forms. The Sanskrit word parame\u015bvara is sometimes translated as \u201cthe individual soul\u201d because the soul is the master of the body and after the destruction of the body he transfers to another form. In that way he is master. But there are others who interpret this parame\u015bvara to be the Supersoul. In either case, both the Supersoul and the individual soul continue. They are not destroyed. One who can see in this way can actually see what is happening."}
