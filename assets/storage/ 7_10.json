There are various living entities, movable and inert. Birds, beasts, men and many other living creatures are moving living entities; trees and plants, however, are inert \u2013 they cannot move, but only stand. Every entity is contained within the scope of 8,400,000 species of life; some of them are moving and some of them are inert. In all cases, however, the seed of their life is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. As stated in Vedic literature, Brahman, or the Supreme Absolute Truth, is that from which everything is emanating. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is Para-brahman, the Supreme Spirit. Brahman is impersonal and Para-brahman is personal. Impersonal Brahman is situated in the personal aspect \u2013 that is stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. Therefore, originally, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the source of everything. He is the root. As the root of a tree maintains the whole tree, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, being the original root of all things, maintains everything in this material manifestation. This is also confirmed in the Vedic literature (Ka\u1e6dha Upani\u1e63ad 2.2.13):nityo nity\u0101n\u0101\u1e41 cetana\u015b cetan\u0101n\u0101meko bah\u016bn\u0101\u1e41 yo vidadh\u0101ti k\u0101m\u0101nHe is the prime eternal among all eternals. He is the supreme living entity of all living entities, and He alone is maintaining all life. One cannot do anything without intelligence, and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a also says that He is the root of all intelligence. Unless a person is intelligent he cannot understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a."}
