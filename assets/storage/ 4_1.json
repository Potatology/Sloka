The kings of all planets are especially meant for the protection of the inhabitants, and therefore the royal order should understand the science of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 in order to be able to rule the citizens and protect them from material bondage to lust. Human life is meant for cultivation of spiritual knowledge, in eternal relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and the executive heads of all states and all planets are obliged to impart this lesson to the citizens by education, culture and devotion. In other words, the executive heads of all states are intended to spread the science of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness so that the people may take advantage of this great science and pursue a successful path, utilizing the opportunity of the human form of life.In this millennium, the sun-god is known as Vivasv\u0101n, the king of the sun, which is the origin of all planets within the solar system. In the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 (5.52) it is stated:yac-cak\u1e63ur e\u1e63a savit\u0101 sakala-grah\u0101\u1e47\u0101\u1e41r\u0101j\u0101 samasta-sura-m\u016brtir a\u015be\u1e63a-tej\u0101\u1e25yasy\u0101j\u00f1ay\u0101 bhramati sambh\u1e5bta-k\u0101la-cakrogovindam \u0101di-puru\u1e63a\u1e41 tam aha\u1e41 bhaj\u0101mi\u201cLet me worship,\u201d Lord Brahm\u0101 said, \u201cthe Supreme Personality of Godhead, Govinda [K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a], who is the original person and under whose order the sun, which is the king of all planets, is assuming immense power and heat. The sun represents the eye of the Lord and traverses its orbit in obedience to His order.\u201dThe sun is the king of the planets, and the sun-god (at present of the name Vivasv\u0101n) rules the sun planet, which is controlling all other planets by supplying heat and light. He is rotating under the order of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a originally made Vivasv\u0101n His first disciple to understand the science of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. The G\u012bt\u0101 is not, therefore, a speculative treatise for the insignificant mundane scholar but is a standard book of knowledge coming down from time immemorial.In the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata (\u015a\u0101nti-parva 348.51\u201352) we can trace out the history of the G\u012bt\u0101 as follows:tret\u0101-yug\u0101dau ca tatovivasv\u0101n manave dadaumanu\u015b ca loka-bh\u1e5bty-artha\u1e41sut\u0101yek\u1e63v\u0101kave dadauik\u1e63v\u0101ku\u1e47\u0101 ca kathitovy\u0101pya lok\u0101n avasthita\u1e25\u201cIn the beginning of the millennium known as Tret\u0101-yuga this science of the relationship with the Supreme was delivered by Vivasv\u0101n to Manu. Manu, being the father of mankind, gave it to his son Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Ik\u1e63v\u0101ku, the king of this earth planet and forefather of the Raghu dynasty, in which Lord R\u0101macandra appeared.\u201d Therefore, Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 existed in human society from the time of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Ik\u1e63v\u0101ku.At the present moment we have just passed through five thousand years of the Kali-yuga, which lasts 432,000 years. Before this there was Dv\u0101para-yuga (800,000 years), and before that there was Tret\u0101-yuga (1,200,000 years). Thus, some 2,005,000 years ago, Manu spoke the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 to his disciple and son Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Ik\u1e63v\u0101ku, the king of this planet earth. The age of the current Manu is calculated to last some 305,300,000 years, of which 120,400,000 have passed. Accepting that before the birth of Manu the G\u012bt\u0101 was spoken by the Lord to His disciple the sun-god Vivasv\u0101n, a rough estimate is that the G\u012bt\u0101 was spoken at least 120,400,000 years ago; and in human society it has been extant for two million years. It was respoken by the Lord again to Arjuna about five thousand years ago. That is the rough estimate of the history of the G\u012bt\u0101, according to the G\u012bt\u0101 itself and according to the version of the speaker, Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. It was spoken to the sun-god Vivasv\u0101n because he is also a k\u1e63atriya and is the father of all k\u1e63atriyas who are descendants of the sun-god, or the s\u016brya-va\u1e41\u015ba k\u1e63atriyas. Because Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is as good as the Vedas, being spoken by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, this knowledge is apauru\u1e63eya, superhuman. Since the Vedic instructions are accepted as they are, without human interpretation, the G\u012bt\u0101 must therefore be accepted without mundane interpretation. The mundane wranglers may speculate on the G\u012bt\u0101 in their own ways, but that is not Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 as it is. Therefore, Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 has to be accepted as it is, from the disciplic succession, and it is described herein that the Lord spoke to the sun-god, the sun-god spoke to his son Manu, and Manu spoke to his son Ik\u1e63v\u0101ku."}
