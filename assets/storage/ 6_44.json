Such an inquisitive transcendentalist stands always above the ritualistic principles of the scriptures.PurportAdvanced yog\u012bs are not very much attracted to the rituals of the scriptures, but they automatically become attracted to the yoga principles, which can elevate them to complete K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, the highest yoga perfection. In the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (3.33.7), such disregard of Vedic rituals by the advanced transcendentalists is explained as follows:aho bata \u015bva-paco \u2019to gar\u012by\u0101nyaj-jihv\u0101gre vartate n\u0101ma tubhyamtepus tapas te juhuvu\u1e25 sasnur \u0101ry\u0101brahm\u0101n\u016bcur n\u0101ma g\u1e5b\u1e47anti ye te\u201cO my Lord! Persons who chant the holy names of Your Lordship are far, far advanced in spiritual life, even if born in families of dog-eaters. Such chanters have undoubtedly performed all kinds of austerities and sacrifices, bathed in all sacred places and finished all scriptural studies.\u201dThe famous example of this was presented by Lord Caitanya, who accepted \u1e6ch\u0101kura Harid\u0101sa as one of His most important disciples. Although \u1e6ch\u0101kura Harid\u0101sa happened to take his birth in a Muslim family, he was elevated to the post of n\u0101m\u0101c\u0101rya by Lord Caitanya due to his rigidly attended principle of chanting three hundred thousand holy names of the Lord daily: Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare. And because he chanted the holy name of the Lord constantly, it is understood that in his previous life he must have passed through all the ritualistic methods of the Vedas, known as \u015babda-brahma. Unless, therefore, one is purified, one cannot take to the principles of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness or become engaged in chanting the holy name of the Lord, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a."}
