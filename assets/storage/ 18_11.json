But he who renounces the fruits of action is called one who has truly renounced.PurportIt is said in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 that one can never give up work at any time. Therefore he who works for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and does not enjoy the fruitive results, who offers everything to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, is actually a renouncer. There are many members of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness who work very hard in their office or in the factory or some other place, and whatever they earn they give to the Society. Such highly elevated souls are actually sanny\u0101s\u012bs and are situated in the renounced order of life. It is clearly outlined here how to renounce the fruits of work and for what purpose fruits should be renounced."}
