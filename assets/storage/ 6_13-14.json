The yoga process is practiced in order to discover and see this localized form of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, and not for any other purpose. The localized vi\u1e63\u1e47u-m\u016brti is the plenary representation of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a dwelling within one\u2019s heart. One who has no program to realize this vi\u1e63\u1e47u-m\u016brti is uselessly engaged in mock yoga practice and is certainly wasting his time. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the ultimate goal of life, and the vi\u1e63\u1e47u-m\u016brti situated in one\u2019s heart is the object of yoga practice. To realize this vi\u1e63\u1e47u-m\u016brti within the heart, one has to observe complete abstinence from sex life; therefore one has to leave home and live alone in a secluded place, remaining seated as mentioned above. One cannot enjoy sex life daily at home or elsewhere and attend a so-called yoga class and thus become a yog\u012b. One has to practice controlling the mind and avoiding all kinds of sense gratification, of which sex life is the chief. In the rules of celibacy written by the great sage Y\u0101j\u00f1avalkya it is said:karma\u1e47\u0101 manas\u0101 v\u0101c\u0101sarv\u0101vasth\u0101su sarvad\u0101sarvatra maithuna-ty\u0101gobrahmacarya\u1e41 pracak\u1e63ate\u201cThe vow of brahmacarya is meant to help one completely abstain from sex indulgence in work, words and mind \u2013 at all times, under all circumstances and in all places.\u201d No one can perform correct yoga practice through sex indulgence. Brahmacarya is taught, therefore, from childhood, when one has no knowledge of sex life. Children at the age of five are sent to the guru-kula, or the place of the spiritual master, and the master trains the young boys in the strict discipline of becoming brahmac\u0101r\u012bs. Without such practice, no one can make advancement in any yoga, whether it be dhy\u0101na, j\u00f1\u0101na or bhakti. One who, however, follows the rules and regulations of married life, having a sexual relationship only with his wife (and that also under regulation), is also called a brahmac\u0101r\u012b. Such a restrained householder brahmac\u0101r\u012b may be accepted in the bhakti school, but the j\u00f1\u0101na and dhy\u0101na schools do not even admit householder brahmac\u0101r\u012bs. They require complete abstinence without compromise. In the bhakti school, a householder brahmac\u0101r\u012b is allowed controlled sex life because the cult of bhakti-yoga is so powerful that one automatically loses sexual attraction, being engaged in the superior service of the Lord. In the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (2.59) it is said:vi\u1e63ay\u0101 vinivartantenir\u0101h\u0101rasya dehina\u1e25rasa-varja\u1e41 raso \u2019py asyapara\u1e41 d\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6dv\u0101 nivartateWhereas others are forced to restrain themselves from sense gratification, a devotee of the Lord automatically refrains because of superior taste. Other than the devotee, no one has any information of that superior taste.Vigata-bh\u012b\u1e25. One cannot be fearless unless one is fully in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. A conditioned soul is fearful due to his perverted memory, his forgetfulness of his eternal relationship with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The Bh\u0101gavatam (11.2.37) says, bhaya\u1e41 dvit\u012by\u0101bhinive\u015bata\u1e25 sy\u0101d \u012b\u015b\u0101d apetasya viparyayo \u2019sm\u1e5bti\u1e25. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is the only basis for fearlessness. Therefore, perfect practice is possible for a person who is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious. And since the ultimate goal of yoga practice is to see the Lord within, a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person is already the best of all yog\u012bs. The principles of the yoga system mentioned herein are different from those of the popular so-called yoga societies."}
