But the Lord is giving an example which may help us to understand. The sky may be the biggest manifestation we can conceive. And in that sky the wind or air is the biggest manifestation in the cosmic world. The movement of the air influences the movements of everything. But although the wind is great, it is still situated within the sky; the wind is not beyond the sky. Similarly, all the wonderful cosmic manifestations are existing by the supreme will of God, and all of them are subordinate to that supreme will. As we generally say, not a blade of grass moves without the will of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Thus everything is moving under His will: by His will everything is being created, everything is being maintained, and everything is being annihilated. Still He is aloof from everything, as the sky is always aloof from the activities of the wind.In the Upani\u1e63ads it is stated, yad-bh\u012b\u1e63\u0101 v\u0101ta\u1e25 pavate: \u201cIt is out of the fear of the Supreme Lord that the wind is blowing.\u201d (Taittir\u012bya Upani\u1e63ad 2.8.1) In the B\u1e5bhad-\u0101ra\u1e47yaka Upani\u1e63ad (3.8.9) it is stated, etasya v\u0101 ak\u1e63arasya pra\u015b\u0101sane g\u0101rgi s\u016brya-candramasau vidh\u1e5btau ti\u1e63\u1e6dhata etasya v\u0101 ak\u1e63arasya pra\u015b\u0101sane g\u0101rgi dy\u0101v-\u0101p\u1e5bthivyau vidh\u1e5btau ti\u1e63\u1e6dhata\u1e25. \u201cBy the supreme order, under the superintendence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the moon, the sun, and the other great planets are moving.\u201d In the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 (5.52) also it is stated,yac-cak\u1e63ur e\u1e63a savit\u0101 sakala-grah\u0101\u1e47\u0101\u1e41r\u0101j\u0101 samasta-sura-m\u016brtir a\u015be\u1e63a-tej\u0101\u1e25yasy\u0101j\u00f1ay\u0101 bhramati sambh\u1e5bta-k\u0101la-cakrogovindam \u0101di-puru\u1e63a\u1e41 tam aha\u1e41 bhaj\u0101miThis is a description of the movement of the sun. It is said that the sun is considered to be one of the eyes of the Supreme Lord and that it has immense potency to diffuse heat and light. Still it is moving in its prescribed orbit by the order and the supreme will of Govinda. So, from the Vedic literature we can find evidence that this material manifestation, which appears to us to be very wonderful and great, is under the complete control of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This will be further explained in the later verses of this chapter."}
