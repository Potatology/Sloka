Such phenomena occur either in great spiritual ecstasy or out of great fear under material conditions. There is no fear in transcendental realization. Arjuna\u2019s symptoms in this situation are out of material fear \u2013 namely, loss of life. This is evident from other symptoms also; he became so impatient that his famous bow G\u0101\u1e47\u1e0d\u012bva was slipping from his hands, and, because his heart was burning within him, he was feeling a burning sensation of the skin. All these are due to a material conception of life."}
