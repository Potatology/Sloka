Thus you will come to Me without fail. I promise you this because you are My very dear friend.PurportThe most confidential part of knowledge is that one should become a pure devotee of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and always think of Him and act for Him. One should not become an official meditator. Life should be so molded that one will always have the chance to think of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. One should always act in such a way that all his daily activities are in connection with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. He should arrange his life in such a way that throughout the twenty-four hours he cannot but think of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. And the Lord\u2019s promise is that anyone who is in such pure K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness will certainly return to the abode of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, where he will be engaged in the association of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a face to face. This most confidential part of knowledge is spoken to Arjuna because he is the dear friend of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Everyone who follows the path of Arjuna can become a dear friend to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and obtain the same perfection as Arjuna.These words stress that one should concentrate his mind upon K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a \u2013 the very form with two hands carrying a flute, the bluish boy with a beautiful face and peacock feathers in His hair. There are descriptions of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a found in the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 and other literatures. One should fix his mind on this original form of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. One should not even divert his attention to other forms of the Lord. The Lord has multiforms as Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, R\u0101ma, Var\u0101ha, etc., but a devotee should concentrate his mind on the form that was present before Arjuna. Concentration of the mind on the form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a constitutes the most confidential part of knowledge, and this is disclosed to Arjuna because Arjuna is the most dear friend of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s."}
