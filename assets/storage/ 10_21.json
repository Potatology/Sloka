Among all the luminaries shining in the sky, the sun is the chief, and in the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 the sun is accepted as the glowing eye of the Supreme Lord. There are fifty varieties of wind blowing in space, and of these winds the controlling deity, Mar\u012bci, represents K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.Among the stars, the moon is the most prominent at night, and thus the moon represents K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. It appears from this verse that the moon is one of the stars; therefore the stars that twinkle in the sky also reflect the light of the sun. The theory that there are many suns within the universe is not accepted by Vedic literature. The sun is one, and as by the reflection of the sun the moon illuminates, so also do the stars. Since Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 indicates herein that the moon is one of the stars, the twinkling stars are not suns but are similar to the moon."}
