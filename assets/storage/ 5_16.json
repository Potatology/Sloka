It is stated in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, sarva\u1e41 j\u00f1\u0101na-plavena, j\u00f1\u0101n\u0101gni\u1e25 sarva-karm\u0101\u1e47i and na hi j\u00f1\u0101nena sad\u1e5b\u015bam. Knowledge is always highly esteemed. And what is that knowledge? Perfect knowledge is achieved when one surrenders unto K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, as is said in the Seventh Chapter, nineteenth verse: bah\u016bn\u0101\u1e41 janman\u0101m ante j\u00f1\u0101nav\u0101n m\u0101\u1e41 prapadyate. After passing through many, many births, when one perfect in knowledge surrenders unto K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, or when one attains K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, then everything is revealed to him, as everything is revealed by the sun in the daytime. The living entity is bewildered in so many ways. For instance, when he unceremoniously thinks himself God, he actually falls into the last snare of nescience. If a living entity is God, then how can he become bewildered by nescience? Does God become bewildered by nescience? If so, then nescience, or Satan, is greater than God. Real knowledge can be obtained from a person who is in perfect K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Therefore, one has to seek out such a bona fide spiritual master and, under him, learn what K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is, for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness will certainly drive away all nescience, as the sun drives away darkness. Even though a person may be in full knowledge that he is not this body but is transcendental to the body, he still may not be able to discriminate between the soul and the Supersoul. However, he can know everything well if he cares to take shelter of the perfect, bona fide K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious spiritual master. One can know God and one\u2019s relationship with God only when one actually meets a representative of God. A representative of God never claims that he is God, although he is paid all the respect ordinarily paid to God because he has knowledge of God. One has to learn the distinction between God and the living entity. Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a therefore stated in the Second Chapter (2.12) that every living being is individual and that the Lord also is individual. They were all individuals in the past, they are individuals at present, and they will continue to be individuals in the future, even after liberation. At night we see everything as one in the darkness, but in day, when the sun is up, we see everything in its real identity. Identity with individuality in spiritual life is real knowledge."}
