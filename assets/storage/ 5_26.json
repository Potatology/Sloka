The Bh\u0101gavatam (4.22.39) confirms this fact as follows:yat-p\u0101da-pa\u1e45kaja-pal\u0101\u015ba-vil\u0101sa-bhakty\u0101karm\u0101\u015baya\u1e41 grathitam udgrathayanti santa\u1e25tadvan na rikta-matayo yatayo \u2019pi ruddha-sroto-ga\u1e47\u0101s tam ara\u1e47a\u1e41 bhaja v\u0101sudevam\u201cJust try to worship, in devotional service, V\u0101sudeva, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Even great sages are not able to control the forces of the senses as effectively as those who are engaged in transcendental bliss by serving the lotus feet of the Lord, uprooting the deep-grown desire for fruitive activities.\u201dIn the conditioned soul the desire to enjoy the fruitive results of work is so deep-rooted that it is very difficult even for the great sages to control such desires, despite great endeavors. A devotee of the Lord, constantly engaged in devotional service in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, perfect in self-realization, very quickly attains liberation in the Supreme. Owing to his complete knowledge in self-realization, he always remains in trance. To cite an analogous example of this:dar\u015bana-dhy\u0101na-sa\u1e41spar\u015bairmatsya-k\u016brma-viha\u1e45gam\u0101\u1e25sv\u0101ny apaty\u0101ni pu\u1e63\u1e47antitath\u0101ham api padma-ja\u201cBy vision, by meditation and by touch only do the fish, the tortoise and the birds maintain their offspring. Similarly do I also, O Padmaja!\u201dThe fish brings up its offspring simply by looking at them. The tortoise brings up its offspring simply by meditation. The eggs of the tortoise are laid on land, and the tortoise meditates on the eggs while in the water. Similarly, the devotee in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, although far away from the Lord\u2019s abode, can elevate himself to that abode simply by thinking of Him constantly \u2013 by engagement in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. He does not feel the pangs of material miseries; this state of life is called brahma-nirv\u0101\u1e47a, or the absence of material miseries due to being constantly immersed in the Supreme."}
