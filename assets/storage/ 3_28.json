He knows that he is part and parcel of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and that his position should not be in the material creation. He knows his real identity as part and parcel of the Supreme, who is eternal bliss and knowledge, and he realizes that somehow or other he is entrapped in the material conception of life. In his pure state of existence he is meant to dovetail his activities in devotional service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. He therefore engages himself in the activities of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and becomes naturally unattached to the activities of the material senses, which are all circumstantial and temporary. He knows that his material condition of life is under the supreme control of the Lord; consequently he is not disturbed by all kinds of material reactions, which he considers to be the mercy of the Lord. According to \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, one who knows the Absolute Truth in three different features \u2013 namely Brahman, Param\u0101tm\u0101 and the Supreme Personality of Godhead \u2013 is called tattva-vit, for he knows also his own factual position in relationship with the Supreme."}
