It will cause perpetual habitation in hell.\u201d Such statements by Arjuna were due to ignorance only. He wanted to become nonviolent in the discharge of his specific duty. For a k\u1e63atriya to be on the battlefield and to become nonviolent is the philosophy of fools. In the Par\u0101\u015bara-sm\u1e5bti, or religious codes made by Par\u0101\u015bara, the great sage and father of Vy\u0101sadeva, it is stated:k\u1e63atriyo hi praj\u0101 rak\u1e63an\u015bastra-p\u0101\u1e47i\u1e25 prada\u1e47\u1e0dayannirjitya para-sainy\u0101dik\u1e63iti\u1e41 dharme\u1e47a p\u0101layet\u201cThe k\u1e63atriya\u2019s duty is to protect the citizens from all kinds of difficulties, and for that reason he has to apply violence in suitable cases for law and order. Therefore he has to conquer the soldiers of inimical kings, and thus, with religious principles, he should rule over the world.\u201dConsidering all aspects, Arjuna had no reason to refrain from fighting. If he should conquer his enemies, he would enjoy the kingdom; and if he should die in the battle, he would be elevated to the heavenly planets, whose doors were wide open to him. Fighting would be for his benefit in either case."}
