Only in this way can you enter into the mysteries of My understanding.My dear Arjuna, only by undivided devotional service can I be understood as I am, standing before you, and can thus be seen directly. Only in this way can you enter into the mysteries of My understanding.PurportK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a can be understood only by the process of undivided devotional service. He explicitly explains this in this verse so that unauthorized commentators, who try to understand Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 by the speculative process, will know that they are simply wasting their time. No one can understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a or how He came from parents in a four-handed form and at once changed Himself into a two-handed form. These things are very difficult to understand by study of the Vedas or by philosophical speculation. Therefore it is clearly stated here that no one can see Him or enter into understanding of these matters. Those who, however, are very experienced students of Vedic literature can learn about Him from the Vedic literature in so many ways. There are so many rules and regulations, and if one at all wants to understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, he must follow the regulative principles described in the authoritative literature. One can perform penance in accordance with those principles. For example, to undergo serious penances one may observe fasting on Janm\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dam\u012b, the day on which K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a appeared, and on the two days of Ek\u0101da\u015b\u012b (the eleventh day after the new moon and the eleventh day after the full moon). As far as charity is concerned, it is plain that charity should be given to the devotees of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a who are engaged in His devotional service to spread the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a philosophy, or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, throughout the world. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is a benediction to humanity. Lord Caitanya was appreciated by R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b as the most munificent man of charity because love of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, which is very difficult to achieve, was distributed freely by Him. So if one gives some amount of his money to persons involved in distributing K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, that charity, given to spread K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, is the greatest charity in the world. And if one worships as prescribed in the temple (in the temples in India there is always some statue, usually of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a), that is a chance to progress by offering worship and respect to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. For the beginners in devotional service to the Lord, temple worship is essential, and this is confirmed in the Vedic literature (\u015avet\u0101\u015bvatara Upani\u1e63ad 6.23):yasya deve par\u0101 bhaktiryath\u0101 deve tath\u0101 gurautasyaite kathit\u0101 hy arth\u0101\u1e25prak\u0101\u015bante mah\u0101tmana\u1e25One who has unflinching devotion for the Supreme Lord and is directed by the spiritual master, in whom he has similar unflinching faith, can see the Supreme Personality of Godhead by revelation. One cannot understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a by mental speculation. For one who does not take personal training under the guidance of a bona fide spiritual master, it is impossible to even begin to understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The word tu is specifically used here to indicate that no other process can be used, can be recommended, or can be successful in understanding K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.The personal forms of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the two-handed form and the four-handed, are described as su-durdar\u015bam, very difficult to see. They are completely different from the temporary universal form shown to Arjuna. The four-handed form of N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a and the two-handed form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a are eternal and transcendental, whereas the universal form exhibited to Arjuna is temporary. The words tvad anyena na d\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6da-p\u016brvam (verse 47) state that before Arjuna, no one had seen that universal form. Also, they suggest that amongst the devotees there was no necessity of showing it. That form was exhibited by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a at the request of Arjuna so that in the future, when one represents himself as an incarnation of God, people can ask to see his universal form.The word na, used repeatedly in the previous verse, indicates that one should not be very much proud of such credentials as an academic education in Vedic literature. One must take to the devotional service of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Only then can one attempt to write commentaries on Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101.K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a changes from the universal form to the four-handed form of N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a and then to His own natural form of two hands. This indicates that the four-handed forms and other forms mentioned in Vedic literature are all emanations of the original two-handed K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. He is the origin of all emanations. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is distinct even from these forms, what to speak of the impersonal conception. As far as the four-handed forms of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a are concerned, it is stated clearly that even the most identical four-handed form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a (which is known as Mah\u0101-vi\u1e63\u1e47u, who is lying on the cosmic ocean and from whose breathing so many innumerable universes are passing out and entering) is also an expansion of the Supreme Lord. As stated in the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 (5.48),yasyaika-ni\u015bvasita-k\u0101lam ath\u0101valambyaj\u012bvanti loma-vila-j\u0101 jagad-a\u1e47\u1e0da-n\u0101th\u0101\u1e25vi\u1e63\u1e47ur mah\u0101n sa iha yasya kal\u0101-vi\u015be\u1e63ogovindam \u0101di-puru\u1e63a\u1e41 tam aha\u1e41 bhaj\u0101mi\u201cThe Mah\u0101-vi\u1e63\u1e47u, into whom all the innumerable universes enter and from whom they come forth again simply by His breathing process, is a plenary expansion of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Therefore I worship Govinda, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the cause of all causes.\u201d Therefore one should conclusively worship the personal form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as the Supreme Personality of Godhead who has eternal bliss and knowledge. He is the source of all forms of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, He is the source of all forms of incarnation, and He is the original Supreme Personality, as confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101.In the Vedic literature (Gop\u0101la-t\u0101pan\u012b Upani\u1e63ad 1.1) the following statement appears:sac-cid-\u0101nanda-r\u016bp\u0101yak\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47\u0101y\u0101kli\u1e63\u1e6da-k\u0101ri\u1e47enamo ved\u0101nta-vedy\u0101yagurave buddhi-s\u0101k\u1e63i\u1e47e\u201cI offer my respectful obeisances unto K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who has a transcendental form of bliss, eternity and knowledge. I offer my respect to Him, because understanding Him means understanding the Vedas, and He is therefore the supreme spiritual master.\u201d Then it is said, k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47o vai parama\u1e41 daivatam: \u201cK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\u201d (Gop\u0101la-t\u0101pan\u012b Upani\u1e63ad 1.3) Eko va\u015b\u012b sarva-ga\u1e25 k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a \u012b\u1e0dya\u1e25: \u201cThat one K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and He is worshipable.\u201d Eko \u2019pi san bahudh\u0101 yo \u2019vabh\u0101ti: \u201cK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is one, but He is manifested in unlimited forms and expanded incarnations.\u201d (Gop\u0101la-t\u0101pan\u012b Upani\u1e63ad 1.21)The Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 (5.1) says,\u012b\u015bvara\u1e25 parama\u1e25 k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u1e25sac-cid-\u0101nanda-vigraha\u1e25an\u0101dir \u0101dir govinda\u1e25sarva-k\u0101ra\u1e47a-k\u0101ra\u1e47am\u201cThe Supreme Personality of Godhead is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who has a body of eternity, knowledge and bliss. He has no beginning, for He is the beginning of everything. He is the cause of all causes.\u201dElsewhere it is said, yatr\u0101vat\u012br\u1e47a\u1e41 k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47\u0101khya\u1e41 para\u1e41 brahma nar\u0101k\u1e5bti: \u201cThe Supreme Absolute Truth is a person, His name is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and He sometimes descends on this earth.\u201d Similarly, in the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam we find a description of all kinds of incarnations of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and in this list the name of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a also appears. But then it is said that this K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is not an incarnation of God but is the original Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself (ete c\u0101\u1e41\u015ba-kal\u0101\u1e25 pu\u1e41sa\u1e25 k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47as tu bhagav\u0101n svayam).Similarly, in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 the Lord says, matta\u1e25 paratara\u1e41 n\u0101nyat: \u201cThere is nothing superior to My form as the Personality of Godhead K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\u201d He also says elsewhere in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, aham \u0101dir hi dev\u0101n\u0101m: \u201cI am the origin of all the demigods.\u201d And after understanding Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Arjuna also confirms this in the following words: para\u1e41 brahma para\u1e41 dh\u0101ma pavitra\u1e41 parama\u1e41 bhav\u0101n, \u201cI now fully understand that You are the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Absolute Truth, and that You are the refuge of everything.\u201d Therefore the universal form which K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a showed to Arjuna is not the original form of God. The original is the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a form. The universal form, with its thousands and thousands of heads and hands, is manifest just to draw the attention of those who have no love for God. It is not God\u2019s original form.The universal form is not attractive for pure devotees, who are in love with the Lord in different transcendental relationships. The Supreme Godhead exchanges transcendental love in His original form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Therefore to Arjuna, who was so intimately related with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in friendship, this form of the universal manifestation was not pleasing; rather, it was fearful. Arjuna, who was a constant companion of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s, must have had transcendental eyes; he was not an ordinary man. Therefore he was not captivated by the universal form. This form may seem wonderful to persons who are involved in elevating themselves by fruitive activities, but to persons who are engaged in devotional service the two-handed form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the most dear."}
