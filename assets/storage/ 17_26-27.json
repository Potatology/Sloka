The performer of such sacrifice is also called sat, as are all works of sacrifice, penance and charity which, true to the absolute nature, are performed to please the Supreme Person, O son of P\u1e5bth\u0101.PurportThe words pra\u015baste karma\u1e47i, or \u201cprescribed duties,\u201d indicate that there are many activities prescribed in the Vedic literature which are purificatory processes, beginning from the time of conception up to the end of one\u2019s life. Such purificatory processes are adopted for the ultimate liberation of the living entity. In all such activities it is recommended that one vibrate o\u1e41 tat sat. The words sad-bh\u0101ve and s\u0101dhu-bh\u0101ve indicate the transcendental situation. Acting in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is called sattva, and one who is fully conscious of the activities of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is called a s\u0101dhu. In the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (3.25.25) it is said that the transcendental subject matter becomes clear in the association of the devotees. The words used are sat\u0101\u1e41 prasa\u1e45g\u0101t. Without good association, one cannot achieve transcendental knowledge. When initiating a person or offering the sacred thread, one vibrates the words o\u1e41 tat sat. Similarly, in all kinds of performance of yaj\u00f1a the object is the Supreme, o\u1e41 tat sat. The word tad-arth\u012byam further means offering service to anything which represents the Supreme, including such service as cooking and helping in the Lord\u2019s temple, or any other kind of work for broadcasting the glories of the Lord. These supreme words o\u1e41 tat sat are thus used in many ways to perfect all activities and make everything complete."}
