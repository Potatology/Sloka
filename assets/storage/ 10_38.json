Of secret things I am silence, and of the wise I am the wisdom.PurportThere are many suppressing agents, of which the most important are those that cut down miscreants. When miscreants are punished, the agency of chastisement represents K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Among those who are trying to be victorious in some field of activity, the most victorious element is morality. Among the confidential activities of hearing, thinking and meditating, silence is most important because by silence one can make progress very quickly. The wise man is he who can discriminate between matter and spirit, between God\u2019s superior and inferior natures. Such knowledge is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself."}
