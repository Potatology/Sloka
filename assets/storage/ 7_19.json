Such a great soul is very rare.After many births and deaths, he who is actually in knowledge surrenders unto Me, knowing Me to be the cause of all causes and all that is. Such a great soul is very rare.PurportThe living entity, while executing devotional service or transcendental rituals after many, many births, may actually become situated in transcendental pure knowledge that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the ultimate goal of spiritual realization. In the beginning of spiritual realization, while one is trying to give up one\u2019s attachment to materialism, there is some leaning towards impersonalism, but when one is further advanced he can understand that there are activities in the spiritual life and that these activities constitute devotional service. Realizing this, he becomes attached to the Supreme Personality of Godhead and surrenders to Him. At such a time one can understand that Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s mercy is everything, that He is the cause of all causes, and that this material manifestation is not independent from Him. He realizes the material world to be a perverted reflection of spiritual variegatedness and realizes that in everything there is a relationship with the Supreme Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Thus he thinks of everything in relation to V\u0101sudeva, or \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Such a universal vision of V\u0101sudeva precipitates one\u2019s full surrender to the Supreme Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as the highest goal. Such surrendered great souls are very rare.This verse is very nicely explained in the Third Chapter (verses 14 and 15) of the \u015avet\u0101\u015bvatara Upani\u1e63ad:sahasra-\u015b\u012br\u1e63\u0101 puru\u1e63a\u1e25sahasr\u0101k\u1e63a\u1e25 sahasra-p\u0101tsa bh\u016bmi\u1e41 vi\u015bvato v\u1e5btv\u0101-ty\u0101ti\u1e63\u1e6dhad da\u015b\u0101\u1e45gulampuru\u1e63a eveda\u1e41 sarva\u1e41yad bh\u016bta\u1e41 yac ca bhavyamut\u0101m\u1e5btatvasye\u015b\u0101noyad annen\u0101tirohati\u201cLord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u has thousands of heads, thousands of eyes and thousands of feet. Entirely encompassing the whole universe, He still extends beyond it by ten fingers\u2019 breadth. He is in fact this entire universe. He is all that was and all that will be. He is the Lord of immortality and of all that is nourished by food.\u201d In the Ch\u0101ndogya Upani\u1e63ad (5.1.15) it is said, na vai v\u0101co na cak\u1e63\u016b\u1e41\u1e63i na \u015brotr\u0101\u1e47i na man\u0101\u1e41s\u012bty \u0101cak\u1e63ate pr\u0101\u1e47a iti ev\u0101cak\u1e63ate pr\u0101\u1e47o hy evait\u0101ni sarv\u0101\u1e47i bhavanti: \u201cIn the body of a living being neither the power to speak, nor the power to see, nor the power to hear, nor the power to think is the prime factor; it is life which is the center of all activities.\u201d Similarly Lord V\u0101sudeva, or the Personality of Godhead, Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, is the prime entity in everything. In this body there are powers of speaking, of seeing, of hearing, of mental activities, etc. But these are not important if not related to the Supreme Lord. And because V\u0101sudeva is all-pervading and everything is V\u0101sudeva, the devotee surrenders in full knowledge (cf. Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 7.17 and 11.40)."}
