Of all cheating processes, gambling stands supreme and therefore represents K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. As the Supreme, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a can be more deceitful than any mere man. If K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a chooses to deceive a person, no one can surpass Him in His deceit. His greatness is not simply one-sided \u2013 it is all-sided.Among the victorious, He is victory. He is the splendor of the splendid. Among the enterprising and industrious, He is the most enterprising, the most industrious. Among adventurers He is the most adventurous, and among the strong He is the strongest. When K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was present on earth, no one could surpass Him in strength. Even in His childhood He lifted Govardhana Hill. No one can surpass Him in cheating, no one can surpass Him in splendor, no one can surpass Him in victory, no one can surpass Him in enterprise, and no one can surpass Him in strength."}
