Similarly, all the purposes of the Vedas can be served to one who knows the purpose behind them.PurportThe rituals and sacrifices mentioned in the karma-k\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da division of the Vedic literature are meant to encourage gradual development of self-realization. And the purpose of self-realization is clearly stated in the Fifteenth Chapter of the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (15.15): the purpose of studying the Vedas is to know Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the primeval cause of everything. So, self-realization means understanding K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and one\u2019s eternal relationship with Him. The relationship of the living entities with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is also mentioned in the Fifteenth Chapter of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (15.7). The living entities are parts and parcels of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a; therefore, revival of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness by the individual living entity is the highest perfectional stage of Vedic knowledge. This is confirmed in the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (3.33.7) as follows:aho bata \u015bva-paco \u2019to gar\u012by\u0101nyaj-jihv\u0101gre vartate n\u0101ma tubhyamtepus tapas te juhuvu\u1e25 sasnur \u0101ry\u0101brahm\u0101n\u016bcur n\u0101ma g\u1e5b\u1e47anti ye te\u201cO my Lord, a person who is chanting Your holy name, although born of a low family like that of a ca\u1e47\u1e0d\u0101la [dog-eater], is situated on the highest platform of self-realization. Such a person must have performed all kinds of penances and sacrifices according to Vedic rituals and studied the Vedic literatures many, many times after taking his bath in all the holy places of pilgrimage. Such a person is considered to be the best of the \u0100ryan family.\u201dSo one must be intelligent enough to understand the purpose of the Vedas, without being attached to the rituals only, and must not desire to be elevated to the heavenly kingdoms for a better quality of sense gratification. It is not possible for the common man in this age to follow all the rules and regulations of the Vedic rituals, nor is it possible to study all of the Ved\u0101nta and the Upani\u1e63ads thoroughly. It requires much time, energy, knowledge and resources to execute the purposes of the Vedas. This is hardly possible in this age. The best purpose of Vedic culture is served, however, by chanting the holy name of the Lord, as recommended by Lord Caitanya, the deliverer of all fallen souls. When Lord Caitanya was asked by a great Vedic scholar, Prak\u0101\u015b\u0101nanda Sarasvat\u012b, why He, the Lord, was chanting the holy name of the Lord like a sentimentalist instead of studying Ved\u0101nta philosophy, the Lord replied that His spiritual master had found Him to be a great fool and thus asked Him to chant the holy name of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. He did so, and became ecstatic like a madman. In this Age of Kali, most of the population is foolish and not adequately educated to understand Ved\u0101nta philosophy; the best purpose of Ved\u0101nta philosophy is served by inoffensively chanting the holy name of the Lord. Ved\u0101nta is the last word in Vedic wisdom, and the author and knower of the Ved\u0101nta philosophy is Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a; and the highest Ved\u0101ntist is the great soul who takes pleasure in chanting the holy name of the Lord. That is the ultimate purpose of all Vedic mysticism."}
