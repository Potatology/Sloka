In the transcendental association of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, one can understand how the Supreme Lord is the governing principle of the material manifestation and even of the demigods. Gradually, by such transcendental association, one becomes convinced of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and at the time of death such a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person can never forget K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Naturally he is thus promoted to the planet of the Supreme Lord, Goloka V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana.This Seventh Chapter particularly explains how one can become a fully K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person. The beginning of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is association of persons who are K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious. Such association is spiritual and puts one directly in touch with the Supreme Lord, and, by His grace, one can understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to be the Supreme Personality of Godhead. At the same time one can really understand the constitutional position of the living entity and how the living entity forgets K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and becomes entangled in material activities. By gradual development of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness in good association, the living entity can understand that due to forgetfulness of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a he has become conditioned by the laws of material nature. He can also understand that this human form of life is an opportunity to regain K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and that it should be fully utilized to attain the causeless mercy of the Supreme Lord.Many subjects have been discussed in this chapter: the man in distress, the inquisitive man, the man in want of material necessities, knowledge of Brahman, knowledge of Param\u0101tm\u0101, liberation from birth, death and diseases, and worship of the Supreme Lord. However, he who is actually elevated in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness does not care for the different processes. He simply directly engages himself in activities of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and thereby factually attains his constitutional position as an eternal servitor of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. In such a situation he takes pleasure in hearing and glorifying the Supreme Lord in pure devotional service. He is convinced that by his doing so, all his objectives will be fulfilled. This determined faith is called d\u1e5b\u1e0dha-vrata, and it is the beginning of bhakti-yoga, or transcendental loving service. That is the verdict of all scriptures. This Seventh Chapter of the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is the substance of that conviction.Thus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Seventh Chapter of the \u015ar\u012bmad Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 in the matter of Knowledge of the Absolute."}
