The sounding of the transcendental conchshells indicated that there was no hope of victory for the other side because K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was on the side of the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas. Jayas tu p\u0101\u1e47\u1e0du-putr\u0101\u1e47\u0101\u1e41 ye\u1e63\u0101\u1e41 pak\u1e63e jan\u0101rdana\u1e25. Victory is always with persons like the sons of P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0du because Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is associated with them. And whenever and wherever the Lord is present, the goddess of fortune is also there because the goddess of fortune never lives alone without her husband. Therefore, victory and fortune were awaiting Arjuna, as indicated by the transcendental sound produced by the conchshell of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, or Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Besides that, the chariot on which both the friends were seated had been donated by Agni (the fire-god) to Arjuna, and this indicated that this chariot was capable of conquering all sides, wherever it was drawn over the three worlds."}
