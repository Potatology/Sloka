A person may appear to be irreligious, but if he has the qualifications of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness wholly and fully, he is to be understood to be a s\u0101dhu. And du\u1e63k\u1e5bt\u0101m applies to those who do not care for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Such miscreants, or du\u1e63k\u1e5bt\u0101m, are described as foolish and the lowest of mankind, even though they may be decorated with mundane education, whereas a person who is one hundred percent engaged in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is accepted as a s\u0101dhu, even though such a person may be neither learned nor well cultured. As far as the atheistic are concerned, it is not necessary for the Supreme Lord to appear as He is to destroy them, as He did with the demons R\u0101va\u1e47a and Ka\u1e41sa. The Lord has many agents who are quite competent to vanquish demons. But the Lord especially descends to appease His unalloyed devotees, who are always harassed by the demoniac. The demon harasses the devotee, even though the latter may happen to be his kin. Although Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja was the son of Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu, he was nonetheless persecuted by his father; although Devak\u012b, the mother of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, was the sister of Ka\u1e41sa, she and her husband Vasudeva were persecuted only because K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was to be born of them. So Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a appeared primarily to deliver Devak\u012b rather than kill Ka\u1e41sa, but both were performed simultaneously. Therefore it is said here that to deliver the devotee and vanquish the demon miscreants, the Lord appears in different incarnations.In the Caitanya-carit\u0101m\u1e5bta of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47ad\u0101sa Kavir\u0101ja, the following verses (Madhya 20.263\u2013264) summarize these principles of incarnation:s\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6di-hetu yei m\u016brti prapa\u00f1ce avataresei \u012b\u015bvara-m\u016brti \u2018avat\u0101ra\u2019 n\u0101ma dharem\u0101y\u0101t\u012bta paravyome sab\u0101ra avasth\u0101navi\u015bve avatari\u2019 dhare \u2018avat\u0101ra\u2019 n\u0101ma\u201cThe avat\u0101ra, or incarnation of Godhead, descends from the kingdom of God for material manifestation. And the particular form of the Personality of Godhead who so descends is called an incarnation, or avat\u0101ra. Such incarnations are situated in the spiritual world, the kingdom of God. When they descend to the material creation, they assume the name avat\u0101ra.\u201dThere are various kinds of avat\u0101ras, such as puru\u1e63\u0101vat\u0101ras, gu\u1e47\u0101vat\u0101ras, l\u012bl\u0101vat\u0101ras, \u015bakty-\u0101ve\u015ba avat\u0101ras, manvantara-avat\u0101ras and yug\u0101vat\u0101ras \u2013 all appearing on schedule all over the universe. But Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the primeval Lord, the fountainhead of all avat\u0101ras. Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a descends for the specific purpose of mitigating the anxieties of the pure devotees, who are very anxious to see Him in His original V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana pastimes. Therefore, the prime purpose of the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a avat\u0101ra is to satisfy His unalloyed devotees.The Lord says that He incarnates Himself in every millennium. This indicates that He incarnates also in the Age of Kali. As stated in the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, the incarnation in the Age of Kali is Lord Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu, who spread the worship of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a by the sa\u1e45k\u012brtana movement (congregational chanting of the holy names) and spread K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness throughout India. He predicted that this culture of sa\u1e45k\u012brtana would be broadcast all over the world, from town to town and village to village. Lord Caitanya as the incarnation of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Personality of Godhead, is described secretly but not directly in the confidential parts of the revealed scriptures, such as the Upani\u1e63ads, Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata and Bh\u0101gavatam. The devotees of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a are very much attracted by the sa\u1e45k\u012brtana movement of Lord Caitanya. This avat\u0101ra of the Lord does not kill the miscreants, but delivers them by His causeless mercy."}
