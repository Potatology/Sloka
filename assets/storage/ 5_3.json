Such a person, free from all dualities, easily overcomes material bondage and is completely liberated, O mighty-armed Arjuna.PurportOne who is fully in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is always a renouncer because he feels neither hatred nor desire for the results of his actions. Such a renouncer, dedicated to the transcendental loving service of the Lord, is fully qualified in knowledge because he knows his constitutional position in his relationship with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. He knows fully well that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the whole and that he is part and parcel of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Such knowledge is perfect because it is qualitatively and quantitatively correct. The concept of oneness with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is incorrect because the part cannot be equal to the whole. Knowledge that one is one in quality yet different in quantity is correct transcendental knowledge leading one to become full in himself, having nothing to aspire to or lament over. There is no duality in his mind because whatever he does, he does for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Being thus freed from the platform of dualities, he is liberated \u2013 even in this material world."}
