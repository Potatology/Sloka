It is clearly stated there that above the innumerable living entities, some of whom are conditioned and some of whom are liberated, there is the Supreme Personality, who is Param\u0101tm\u0101. The Upani\u1e63adic verse runs as follows: nityo nity\u0101n\u0101\u1e41 cetana\u015b cetan\u0101n\u0101m. The purport is that amongst all the living entities, both conditioned and liberated, there is one supreme living personality, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who maintains them and gives them all the facility of enjoyment according to different work. That Supreme Personality of Godhead is situated in everyone\u2019s heart as Param\u0101tm\u0101. A wise man who can understand Him is eligible to attain perfect peace, not others."}
