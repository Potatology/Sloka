K\u1e63at means hurt. One who gives protection from harm is called k\u1e63atriya (tr\u0101yate \u2013 to give protection). The k\u1e63atriyas are trained for killing in the forest. A k\u1e63atriya would go into the forest and challenge a tiger face to face and fight with the tiger with his sword. When the tiger was killed, it would be offered the royal order of cremation. This system has been followed even up to the present day by the k\u1e63atriya kings of Jaipur state. The k\u1e63atriyas are specially trained for challenging and killing because religious violence is sometimes a necessary factor. Therefore, k\u1e63atriyas are never meant for accepting directly the order of sanny\u0101sa, or renunciation. Nonviolence in politics may be a diplomacy, but it is never a factor or principle. In the religious law books it is stated:\u0101have\u1e63u mitho \u2019nyonya\u1e41jigh\u0101\u1e41santo mah\u012b-k\u1e63ita\u1e25yuddham\u0101n\u0101\u1e25 para\u1e41 \u015bakty\u0101svarga\u1e41 y\u0101nty apar\u0101\u1e45-mukh\u0101\u1e25yaj\u00f1e\u1e63u pa\u015bavo brahmanhanyante satata\u1e41 dvijai\u1e25sa\u1e41sk\u1e5bt\u0101\u1e25 kila mantrai\u015b cate \u2019pi svargam av\u0101pnuvan\u201cIn the battlefield, a king or k\u1e63atriya, while fighting another king envious of him, is eligible for achieving the heavenly planets after death, as the br\u0101hma\u1e47as also attain the heavenly planets by sacrificing animals in the sacrificial fire.\u201d Therefore, killing on the battlefield on religious principles and killing animals in the sacrificial fire are not at all considered to be acts of violence, because everyone is benefited by the religious principles involved. The animal sacrificed gets a human life immediately without undergoing the gradual evolutionary process from one form to another, and the k\u1e63atriyas killed on the battlefield also attain the heavenly planets, as do the br\u0101hma\u1e47as who attain them by offering sacrifice.There are two kinds of sva-dharmas, specific duties. As long as one is not liberated, one has to perform the duties of his particular body in accordance with religious principles in order to achieve liberation. When one is liberated, one\u2019s sva-dharma \u2013 specific duty \u2013 becomes spiritual and is not in the material bodily concept. In the bodily conception of life there are specific duties for the br\u0101hma\u1e47as and k\u1e63atriyas respectively, and such duties are unavoidable. Sva-dharma is ordained by the Lord, and this will be clarified in the Fourth Chapter. On the bodily plane sva-dharma is called var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama-dharma, or man\u2019s steppingstone for spiritual understanding. Human civilization begins from the stage of var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama-dharma, or specific duties in terms of the specific modes of nature of the body obtained. Discharging one\u2019s specific duty in any field of action in accordance with the orders of higher authorities serves to elevate one to a higher status of life."}
