As far as eating is concerned, it can be regulated only when one is practiced to take and accept pras\u0101dam, sanctified food. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is offered, according to the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (9.26), vegetables, flowers, fruits, grains, milk, etc. In this way, a person in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness becomes automatically trained not to accept food not meant for human consumption, or not in the category of goodness. As far as sleeping is concerned, a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person is always alert in the discharge of his duties in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, and therefore any unnecessary time spent sleeping is considered a great loss. Avyartha-k\u0101latvam: a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person cannot bear to pass a minute of his life without being engaged in the service of the Lord. Therefore, his sleeping is kept to a minimum. His ideal in this respect is \u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b, who was always engaged in the service of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and who could not sleep more than two hours a day, and sometimes not even that. \u1e6ch\u0101kura Harid\u0101sa would not even accept pras\u0101dam nor even sleep for a moment without finishing his daily routine of chanting with his beads three hundred thousand names. As far as work is concerned, a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person does not do anything which is not connected with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s interest, and thus his work is always regulated and is untainted by sense gratification. Since there is no question of sense gratification, there is no material leisure for a person in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. And because he is regulated in all his work, speech, sleep, wakefulness and all other bodily activities, there is no material misery for him."}
