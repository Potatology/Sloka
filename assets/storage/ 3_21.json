And whatever standards he sets by exemplary acts, all the world pursues.PurportPeople in general always require a leader who can teach the public by practical behavior. A leader cannot teach the public to stop smoking if he himself smokes. Lord Caitanya said that a teacher should behave properly before he begins teaching. One who teaches in that way is called \u0101c\u0101rya, or the ideal teacher. Therefore, a teacher must follow the principles of \u015b\u0101stra (scripture) to teach the common man. The teacher cannot manufacture rules against the principles of revealed scriptures. The revealed scriptures, like Manu-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 and similar others, are considered the standard books to be followed by human society. Thus the leader\u2019s teaching should be based on the principles of such standard \u015b\u0101stras. One who desires to improve himself must follow the standard rules as they are practiced by the great teachers. The \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam also affirms that one should follow in the footsteps of great devotees, and that is the way of progress on the path of spiritual realization. The king or the executive head of a state, the father and the schoolteacher are all considered to be natural leaders of the innocent people in general. All such natural leaders have a great responsibility to their dependents; therefore they must be conversant with standard books of moral and spiritual codes."}
