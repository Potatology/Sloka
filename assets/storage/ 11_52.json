Even the demigods are ever seeking the opportunity to see this form, which is so dear.The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: My dear Arjuna, this form of Mine you are now seeing is very difficult to behold. Even the demigods are ever seeking the opportunity to see this form, which is so dear.PurportIn the forty-eighth verse of this chapter Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a concluded revealing His universal form and informed Arjuna that this form is not possible to be seen by so many pious activities, sacrifices, etc. Now here the word su-durdar\u015bam is used, indicating that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s two-handed form is still more confidential. One may be able to see the universal form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a by adding a little tinge of devotional service to various activities like penances, Vedic study and philosophical speculation. It may be possible, but without a tinge of bhakti one cannot see; that has already been explained. Still, beyond that universal form, the form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a with two hands is still more difficult to see, even for demigods like Brahm\u0101 and Lord \u015aiva. They desire to see Him, and we have evidence in the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam that when He was supposed to be in the womb of His mother, Devak\u012b, all the demigods from heaven came to see the marvel of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and they offered nice prayers to the Lord, although He was not at that time visible to them. They waited to see Him. A foolish person may deride Him, thinking Him an ordinary person, and may offer respect not to Him but to the impersonal \u201csomething\u201d within Him, but these are all nonsensical postures. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in His two-armed form is actually desired to be seen by demigods like Brahm\u0101 and \u015aiva.In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (9.11) it is also confirmed, avaj\u0101nanti m\u0101\u1e41 m\u016b\u1e0dh\u0101 m\u0101nu\u1e63\u012b\u1e41 tanum \u0101\u015britam: He is not visible to the foolish persons who deride Him. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s body, as confirmed by Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 and confirmed by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, is completely spiritual and full of bliss and eternality. His body is never like a material body. But for some who make a study of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a by reading Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 or similar Vedic scriptures, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is a problem. For one using a material process, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is considered to be a great historical personality and very learned philosopher, but He is an ordinary man, and even though He was so powerful He had to accept a material body. Ultimately they think that the Absolute Truth is impersonal; therefore they think that from His impersonal feature He assumed a personal feature attached to material nature. This is a materialistic calculation of the Supreme Lord. Another calculation is speculative. Those who are in search of knowledge also speculate on K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and consider Him to be less important than the universal form of the Supreme. Thus some think that the universal form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a which was manifested to Arjuna is more important than His personal form. According to them, the personal form of the Supreme is something imaginary. They believe that in the ultimate issue, the Absolute Truth is not a person. But the transcendental process is described in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, Chapter Four: to hear about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a from authorities. That is the actual Vedic process, and those who are actually in the Vedic line hear about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a from authority, and by repeated hearing about Him, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a becomes dear. As we have several times discussed, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is covered by His yoga-m\u0101y\u0101 potency. He is not to be seen or revealed to anyone and everyone. Only by one to whom He reveals Himself can He be seen. This is confirmed in the Vedic literature; for one who is a surrendered soul, the Absolute Truth can actually be understood. The transcendentalist, by continuous K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and by devotional service to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, can have his spiritual eyes opened and can see K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a by revelation. Such a revelation is not possible even for the demigods; therefore it is difficult even for the demigods to understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and the advanced demigods are always in hope of seeing K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in His two-handed form. The conclusion is that although to see the universal form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is very, very difficult and not possible for anyone and everyone, it is still more difficult to understand His personal form as \u015ay\u0101masundara."}
