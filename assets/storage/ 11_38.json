Nidh\u0101nam means that everything, even the Brahman effulgence, rests on the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. He is the knower of everything that is happening in this world, and if knowledge has any end, He is the end of all knowledge; therefore He is the known and the knowable. He is the object of knowledge because He is all-pervading. Because He is the cause in the spiritual world, He is transcendental. He is also the chief personality in the transcendental world."}
