Due to his being K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious, all impiety within is instantly cleansed, an effect of many, many thousands of yaj\u00f1a performances. By such clearing of consciousness, one becomes fully confident of his eternal position in relationship with the Supreme. His duty thus becomes self-illuminated by the grace of the Lord, and therefore he no longer has any obligations to the Vedic injunctions. Such a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person is no longer interested in material activities and no longer takes pleasure in material arrangements like wine, women and similar infatuations."}
