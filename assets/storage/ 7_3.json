Generally mankind is simply engaged in the animal propensities, namely eating, sleeping, defending and mating, and hardly anyone is interested in transcendental knowledge. The first six chapters of the G\u012bt\u0101 are meant for those who are interested in transcendental knowledge, in understanding the self, the Superself and the process of realization by j\u00f1\u0101na-yoga, dhy\u0101na-yoga and discrimination of the self from matter. However, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a can be known only by persons who are in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Other transcendentalists may achieve impersonal Brahman realization, for this is easier than understanding K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Person, but at the same time He is beyond the knowledge of Brahman and Param\u0101tm\u0101. The yog\u012bs and j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs are confused in their attempts to understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Although the greatest of the impersonalists, \u015ar\u012bp\u0101da \u015aa\u1e45kar\u0101c\u0101rya, has admitted in his G\u012bt\u0101 commentary that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, his followers do not accept K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as such, for it is very difficult to know K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, even though one has transcendental realization of impersonal Brahman.K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the cause of all causes, the primeval Lord Govinda. \u012a\u015bvara\u1e25 parama\u1e25 k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u1e25 sac-cid-\u0101nanda-vigraha\u1e25/ an\u0101dir \u0101dir govinda\u1e25 sarva-k\u0101ra\u1e47a-k\u0101ra\u1e47am. It is very difficult for the nondevotees to know Him. Although nondevotees declare that the path of bhakti, or devotional service, is very easy, they cannot practice it. If the path of bhakti is so easy, as the nondevotee class of men proclaim, then why do they take up the difficult path? Actually the path of bhakti is not easy. The so-called path of bhakti practiced by unauthorized persons without knowledge of bhakti may be easy, but when it is practiced factually according to the rules and regulations, the speculative scholars and philosophers fall away from the path. \u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b writes in his Bhakti-ras\u0101m\u1e5bta-sindhu (1.2.101):\u015bruti-sm\u1e5bti-pur\u0101\u1e47\u0101di-pa\u00f1car\u0101tra-vidhi\u1e41 vin\u0101aik\u0101ntik\u012b harer bhaktirutp\u0101t\u0101yaiva kalpate\u201cDevotional service of the Lord that ignores the authorized Vedic literatures like the Upani\u1e63ads, Pur\u0101\u1e47as and N\u0101rada Pa\u00f1car\u0101tra is simply an unnecessary disturbance in society.\u201dIt is not possible for the Brahman-realized impersonalist or the Param\u0101tm\u0101-realized yog\u012b to understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a the Supreme Personality of Godhead as the son of mother Ya\u015bod\u0101 or the charioteer of Arjuna. Even the great demigods are sometimes confused about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a (muhyanti yat s\u016braya\u1e25). M\u0101\u1e41 tu veda na ka\u015bcana: \u201cNo one knows Me as I am,\u201d the Lord says. And if one does know Him, then sa mah\u0101tm\u0101 su-durlabha\u1e25: \u201cSuch a great soul is very rare.\u201d Therefore unless one practices devotional service to the Lord, one cannot know K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as He is (tattvata\u1e25), even though one is a great scholar or philosopher. Only the pure devotees can know something of the inconceivable transcendental qualities in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a \u2013 His being the cause of all causes, His omnipotence and opulence, and His wealth, fame, strength, beauty, knowledge and renunciation \u2013 because K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is benevolently inclined to His devotees. He is the last word in Brahman realization, and the devotees alone can realize Him as He is. Therefore it is said:ata\u1e25 \u015br\u012b-k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-n\u0101m\u0101dina bhaved gr\u0101hyam indriyai\u1e25sevonmukhe hi jihv\u0101dausvayam eva sphuraty ada\u1e25\u201cNo one can understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as He is by the blunt material senses. But He reveals Himself to the devotees, being pleased with them for their transcendental loving service unto Him.\u201d (Bhakti-ras\u0101m\u1e5bta-sindhu 1.2.234)"}
