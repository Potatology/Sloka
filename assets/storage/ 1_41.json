The ancestors of such corrupt families fall down, because the performances for offering them food and water are entirely stopped.PurportAccording to the rules and regulations of fruitive activities, there is a need to offer periodical food and water to the forefathers of the family. This offering is performed by worship of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, because eating the remnants of food offered to Vi\u1e63\u1e47u can deliver one from all kinds of sinful reactions. Sometimes the forefathers may be suffering from various types of sinful reactions, and sometimes some of them cannot even acquire a gross material body and are forced to remain in subtle bodies as ghosts. Thus, when remnants of pras\u0101dam food are offered to forefathers by descendants, the forefathers are released from ghostly or other kinds of miserable life. Such help rendered to forefathers is a family tradition, and those who are not in devotional life are required to perform such rituals. One who is engaged in the devotional life is not required to perform such actions. Simply by performing devotional service, one can deliver hundreds and thousands of forefathers from all kinds of misery. It is stated in the Bh\u0101gavatam (11.5.41):devar\u1e63i-bh\u016bt\u0101pta-n\u1e5b\u1e47\u0101\u1e41 pit\u1e5d\u1e47\u0101\u1e41na ki\u1e45karo n\u0101yam \u1e5b\u1e47\u012b ca r\u0101jansarv\u0101tman\u0101 ya\u1e25 \u015bara\u1e47a\u1e41 \u015bara\u1e47ya\u1e41gato mukunda\u1e41 parih\u1e5btya kartam\u201cAnyone who has taken shelter of the lotus feet of Mukunda, the giver of liberation, giving up all kinds of obligation, and has taken to the path in all seriousness, owes neither duties nor obligations to the demigods, sages, general living entities, family members, humankind or forefathers.\u201d Such obligations are automatically fulfilled by performance of devotional service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead."}
