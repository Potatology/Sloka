Some are inclined to understand it by empirical, philosophical speculation, and others by devotional service.PurportIn the Second Chapter, verse 39, the Lord explained two kinds of procedures \u2013 namely s\u0101\u1e45khya-yoga and karma-yoga, or buddhi-yoga. In this verse, the Lord explains the same more clearly. S\u0101\u1e45khya-yoga, or the analytical study of the nature of spirit and matter, is the subject matter for persons who are inclined to speculate and understand things by experimental knowledge and philosophy. The other class of men work in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, as it is explained in the sixty-first verse of the Second Chapter. The Lord has explained, also in the thirty-ninth verse, that by working by the principles of buddhi-yoga, or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, one can be relieved from the bonds of action; and, furthermore, there is no flaw in the process. The same principle is more clearly explained in the sixty-first verse \u2013 that this buddhi-yoga is to depend entirely on the Supreme (or more specifically, on K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a), and in this way all the senses can be brought under control very easily. Therefore, both the yogas are interdependent, as religion and philosophy. Religion without philosophy is sentiment, or sometimes fanaticism, while philosophy without religion is mental speculation. The ultimate goal is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, because the philosophers who are also sincerely searching after the Absolute Truth come in the end to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. This is also stated in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. The whole process is to understand the real position of the self in relation to the Superself. The indirect process is philosophical speculation, by which, gradually, one may come to the point of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness; and the other process is directly connecting everything with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Of these two, the path of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is better because it does not depend on purifying the senses by a philosophical process. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is itself the purifying process, and by the direct method of devotional service it is simultaneously easy and sublime."}
