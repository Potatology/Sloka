As the Vedas are eternal, so this truth of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is also eternal. One should have firm faith in this injunction, without envying the Lord. There are many philosophers who write comments on the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 but have no faith in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. They will never be liberated from the bondage of fruitive action. But an ordinary man with firm faith in the eternal injunctions of the Lord, even though unable to execute such orders, becomes liberated from the bondage of the law of karma. In the beginning of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, one may not fully discharge the injunctions of the Lord, but because one is not resentful of this principle and works sincerely without consideration of defeat and hopelessness, he will surely be promoted to the stage of pure K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness."}
