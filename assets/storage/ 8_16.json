Those who attain the highest material planets, the planets of the demigods, are again subjected to repeated birth and death. As persons on earth are elevated to higher planets, people on higher planets such as Brahmaloka, Candraloka and Indraloka fall down to earth. The practice of sacrifice called pa\u00f1c\u0101gni-vidy\u0101, recommended in the Ch\u0101ndogya Upani\u1e63ad, enables one to achieve Brahmaloka, but if, on Brahmaloka, one does not cultivate K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, then he must return to earth. Those who progress in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness on the higher planets are gradually elevated to higher and higher planets and at the time of universal devastation are transferred to the eternal spiritual kingdom. Baladeva Vidy\u0101bh\u016b\u1e63a\u1e47a, in his commentary on Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, quotes this verse:brahma\u1e47\u0101 saha te sarvesampr\u0101pte pratisa\u00f1careparasy\u0101nte k\u1e5bt\u0101tm\u0101na\u1e25pravi\u015banti para\u1e41 padam\u201cWhen there is devastation of this material universe, Brahm\u0101 and his devotees, who are constantly engaged in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, are all transferred to the spiritual universe and to specific spiritual planets according to their desires.\u201d"}
