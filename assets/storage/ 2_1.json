Compassion for the eternal soul is self-realization. The word \u201cMadhus\u016bdana\u201d is significant in this verse. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a killed the demon Madhu, and now Arjuna wanted K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to kill the demon of misunderstanding that had overtaken him in the discharge of his duty. No one knows where compassion should be applied. Compassion for the dress of a drowning man is senseless. A man fallen in the ocean of nescience cannot be saved simply by rescuing his outward dress \u2013 the gross material body. One who does not know this and laments for the outward dress is called a \u015b\u016bdra, or one who laments unnecessarily. Arjuna was a k\u1e63atriya, and this conduct was not expected from him. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, however, can dissipate the lamentation of the ignorant man, and for this purpose the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 was sung by Him. This chapter instructs us in self-realization by an analytical study of the material body and the spirit soul, as explained by the supreme authority, Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. This realization is possible when one works without attachment to fruitive results and is situated in the fixed conception of the real self."}
