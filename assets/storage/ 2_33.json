After fighting and defeating Lord \u015aiva in the dress of a hunter, Arjuna pleased the lord and received as a reward a weapon called p\u0101\u015bupata-astra. Everyone knew that he was a great warrior. Even Dro\u1e47\u0101c\u0101rya gave him benedictions and awarded him the special weapon by which he could kill even his teacher. So he was credited with so many military certificates from many authorities, including his adoptive father Indra, the heavenly king. But if he abandoned the battle, not only would he neglect his specific duty as a k\u1e63atriya, but he would lose all his fame and good name and thus prepare his royal road to hell. In other words, he would go to hell not by fighting but by withdrawing from battle."}
