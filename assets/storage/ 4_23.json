He can become liberated because he knows his constitutional position in relationship with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and thus his mind cannot be drawn from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Consequently, whatever he does, he does for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who is the primeval Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. Therefore, all his works are technically sacrifices because sacrifice aims at satisfying the Supreme Person, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The resultant reactions to all such work certainly merge into transcendence, and one does not suffer material effects."}
