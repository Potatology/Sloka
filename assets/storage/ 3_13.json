Others, who prepare food for personal sense enjoyment, verily eat only sin.PurportThe devotees of the Supreme Lord, or the persons who are in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, are called santas, and they are always in love with the Lord as it is described in the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 (5.38): prem\u0101\u00f1jana-cchurita-bhakti-vilocanena santa\u1e25 sadaiva h\u1e5bdaye\u1e63u vilokayanti. The santas, being always in a compact of love with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Govinda (the giver of all pleasures), or Mukunda (the giver of liberation), or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a (the all-attractive person), cannot accept anything without first offering it to the Supreme Person. Therefore, such devotees always perform yaj\u00f1as in different modes of devotional service, such as \u015brava\u1e47am, k\u012brtanam, smara\u1e47am, arcanam, etc., and these performances of yaj\u00f1as keep them always aloof from all kinds of contamination of sinful association in the material world. Others, who prepare food for self or sense gratification, are not only thieves but also the eaters of all kinds of sins. How can a person be happy if he is both a thief and sinful? It is not possible. Therefore, in order for people to become happy in all respects, they must be taught to perform the easy process of sa\u1e45k\u012brtana-yaj\u00f1a, in full K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Otherwise, there can be no peace or happiness in the world."}
