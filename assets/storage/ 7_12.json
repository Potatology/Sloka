I am, in one sense, everything, but I am independent. I am not under the modes of material nature, for they, on the contrary, are within Me.PurportAll material activities in the world are being conducted under the three modes of material nature. Although these material modes of nature are emanations from the Supreme Lord, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, He is not subject to them. For instance, under the state laws one may be punished, but the king, the lawmaker, is not subject to that law. Similarly, all the modes of material nature \u2013 goodness, passion and ignorance \u2013 are emanations from the Supreme Lord, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, but K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is not subject to material nature. Therefore He is nirgu\u1e47a, which means that these gu\u1e47as, or modes, although issuing from Him, do not affect Him. That is one of the special characteristics of Bhagav\u0101n, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead."}
