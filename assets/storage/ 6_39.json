But for You, no one is to be found who can destroy this doubt.PurportK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the perfect knower of past, present and future. In the beginning of the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, the Lord said that all living entities existed individually in the past, they exist now in the present, and they continue to retain individual identity in the future, even after liberation from the material entanglement. So He has already cleared up the question of the future of the individual living entity. Now, Arjuna wants to know of the future of the unsuccessful transcendentalist. No one is equal to or above K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and certainly the so-called great sages and philosophers who are at the mercy of material nature cannot equal Him. Therefore the verdict of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the final and complete answer to all doubts, because He knows past, present and future perfectly \u2013 but no one knows Him. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious devotees alone can know what is what."}
