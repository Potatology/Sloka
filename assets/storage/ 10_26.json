Of the Gandharvas I am Citraratha, and among perfected beings I am the sage Kapila.Of all trees I am the banyan tree, and of the sages among the demigods I am N\u0101rada. Of the Gandharvas I am Citraratha, and among perfected beings I am the sage Kapila.PurportThe banyan tree (a\u015bvattha) is one of the highest and most beautiful trees, and people in India often worship it as one of their daily morning rituals. Amongst the demigods they also worship N\u0101rada, who is considered the greatest devotee in the universe. Thus he is the representation of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as a devotee. The Gandharva planet is filled with entities who sing beautifully, and among them the best singer is Citraratha. Amongst the perfect living entities, Kapila, the son of Devah\u016bti, is a representative of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. He is considered an incarnation of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and His philosophy is mentioned in the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam. Later on another Kapila became famous, but his philosophy was atheistic. Thus there is a gulf of difference between them."}
