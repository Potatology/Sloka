That is My opinion.PurportThe word bhajate is significant here. Bhajate has its root in the verb bhaj, which is used when there is need of service. The English word \u201cworship\u201d cannot be used in the same sense as bhaj. Worship means to adore, or to show respect and honor to the worthy one. But service with love and faith is especially meant for the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One can avoid worshiping a respectable man or a demigod and may be called discourteous, but one cannot avoid serving the Supreme Lord without being thoroughly condemned. Every living entity is part and parcel of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and thus every living entity is intended to serve the Supreme Lord by his own constitution. Failing to do this, he falls down. The Bh\u0101gavatam (11.5.3) confirms this as follows:ya e\u1e63\u0101\u1e41 puru\u1e63a\u1e41 s\u0101k\u1e63\u0101d\u0101tma-prabhavam \u012b\u015bvaramna bhajanty avaj\u0101nantisth\u0101n\u0101d bhra\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101\u1e25 patanty adha\u1e25\u201cAnyone who does not render service and neglects his duty unto the primeval Lord, who is the source of all living entities, will certainly fall down from his constitutional position.\u201dIn this verse also the word bhajanti is used. Therefore, bhajanti is applicable to the Supreme Lord only, whereas the word \u201cworship\u201d can be applied to demigods or to any other common living entity. The word avaj\u0101nanti, used in this verse of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, is also found in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. Avaj\u0101nanti m\u0101\u1e41 m\u016b\u1e0dh\u0101\u1e25: \u201cOnly the fools and rascals deride the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\u201d Such fools take it upon themselves to write commentaries on the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 without an attitude of service to the Lord. Consequently they cannot properly distinguish between the word bhajanti and the word \u201cworship.\u201dThe culmination of all kinds of yoga practices lies in bhakti yoga. All other yogas are but means to come to the point of bhakti in bhakti-yoga. Yoga actually means bhakti-yoga; all other yogas are progressions toward the destination of bhakti-yoga. From the beginning of karma-yoga to the end of bhakti-yoga is a long way to self-realization. Karma-yoga, without fruitive results, is the beginning of this path. When karma-yoga increases in knowledge and renunciation, the stage is called j\u00f1\u0101na-yoga. When j\u00f1\u0101na-yoga increases in meditation on the Supersoul by different physical processes, and the mind is on Him, it is called a\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101\u1e45ga-yoga. And when one surpasses the a\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101\u1e45ga-yoga and comes to the point of the Supreme Personality of Godhead K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, it is called bhakti-yoga, the culmination. Factually, bhakti-yoga is the ultimate goal, but to analyze bhakti-yoga minutely one has to understand these other yogas. The yog\u012b who is progressive is therefore on the true path of eternal good fortune. One who sticks to a particular point and does not make further progress is called by that particular name: karma-yog\u012b, j\u00f1\u0101na-yog\u012b or dhy\u0101na-yog\u012b, r\u0101ja-yog\u012b, ha\u1e6dha-yog\u012b, etc. If one is fortunate enough to come to the point of bhakti-yoga, it is to be understood that he has surpassed all other yogas. Therefore, to become K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious is the highest stage of yoga, just as, when we speak of Him\u0101layan, we refer to the world\u2019s highest mountains, of which the highest peak, Mount Everest, is considered to be the culmination.It is by great fortune that one comes to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness on the path of bhakti-yoga to become well situated according to the Vedic direction. The ideal yog\u012b concentrates his attention on K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who is called \u015ay\u0101masundara, who is as beautifully colored as a cloud, whose lotuslike face is as effulgent as the sun, whose dress is brilliant with jewels, and whose body is flower-garlanded. Illuminating all sides is His gorgeous luster, which is called the brahma-jyotir. He incarnates in different forms such as R\u0101ma, N\u1e5bsi\u1e41ha, Var\u0101ha and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and He descends like a human being, as the son of mother Ya\u015bod\u0101, and He is known as K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Govinda and V\u0101sudeva. He is the perfect child, husband, friend and master, and He is full with all opulences and transcendental qualities. If one remains fully conscious of these features of the Lord, he is called the highest yog\u012b.This stage of highest perfection in yoga can be attained only by bhakti-yoga, as is confirmed in all Vedic literature:yasya deve par\u0101 bhaktiryath\u0101 deve tath\u0101 gurautasyaite kathit\u0101 hy arth\u0101\u1e25prak\u0101\u015bante mah\u0101tmana\u1e25\u201cOnly unto those great souls who have implicit faith in both the Lord and the spiritual master are all the imports of Vedic knowledge automatically revealed.\u201d (\u015avet\u0101\u015bvatara Upani\u1e63ad 6.23)Bhaktir asya bhajana\u1e41 tad ih\u0101mutrop\u0101dhi-nair\u0101syen\u0101mu\u1e63min mana\u1e25-kalpanam, etad eva nai\u1e63karmyam. \u201cBhakti means devotional service to the Lord which is free from desire for material profit, either in this life or in the next. Devoid of such inclinations, one should fully absorb the mind in the Supreme. That is the purpose of nai\u1e63karmya.\u201d (Gop\u0101la-t\u0101pan\u012b Upani\u1e63ad 1.15)These are some of the means for performance of bhakti, or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, the highest perfectional stage of the yoga system.Thus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Sixth Chapter of the \u015ar\u012bmad Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 in the matter of Dhy\u0101na-yoga."}
