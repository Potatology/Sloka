One should act without attachment for the result; he should be disassociated from the modes of work. A man working in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness in a factory does not associate himself with the work of the factory, nor with the workers of the factory. He simply works for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. And when he gives up the result for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, he is acting transcendentally."}
