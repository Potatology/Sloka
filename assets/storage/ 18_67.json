It is, however, sometimes found that even demoniac persons who are envious of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, worshiping K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in a different way, take to the profession of explaining Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 in a different way to make business, but anyone who desires actually to understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a must avoid such commentaries on Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. Actually the purpose of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is not understandable to those who are sensuous. Even if one is not sensuous but is strictly following the disciplines enjoined in the Vedic scripture, if he is not a devotee he also cannot understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. And even when one poses himself as a devotee of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a but is not engaged in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious activities, he also cannot understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. There are many persons who envy K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a because He has explained in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 that He is the Supreme and that nothing is above Him or equal to Him. There are many persons who are envious of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Such persons should not be told of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, for they cannot understand. There is no possibility of faithless persons\u2019 understanding Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Without understanding K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a from the authority of a pure devotee, one should not try to comment upon Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101."}
