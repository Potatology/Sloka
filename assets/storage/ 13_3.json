That is My opinion.O scion of Bharata, you should understand that I am also the knower in all bodies, and to understand this body and its knower is called knowledge. That is My opinion.PurportWhile discussing the subject of the body and the knower of the body, the soul and the Supersoul, we shall find three different topics of study: the Lord, the living entity, and matter. In every field of activities, in every body, there are two souls: the individual soul and the Supersoul. Because the Supersoul is the plenary expansion of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says, \u201cI am also the knower, but I am not the individual knower of the body. I am the superknower. I am present in every body as the Param\u0101tm\u0101, or Supersoul.\u201dOne who studies the subject matter of the field of activity and the knower of the field very minutely, in terms of this Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, can attain to knowledge.The Lord says, \u201cI am the knower of the field of activities in every individual body.\u201d The individual may be the knower of his own body, but he is not in knowledge of other bodies. The Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is present as the Supersoul in all bodies, knows everything about all bodies. He knows all the different bodies of all the various species of life. A citizen may know everything about his patch of land, but the king knows not only his palace but all the properties possessed by the individual citizens. Similarly, one may be the proprietor of the body individually, but the Supreme Lord is the proprietor of all bodies. The king is the original proprietor of the kingdom, and the citizen is the secondary proprietor. Similarly, the Supreme Lord is the supreme proprietor of all bodies.The body consists of the senses. The Supreme Lord is H\u1e5b\u1e63\u012bke\u015ba, which means \u201cthe controller of the senses.\u201d He is the original controller of the senses, just as the king is the original controller of all the activities of the state; the citizens are secondary controllers. The Lord says, \u201cI am also the knower.\u201d This means that He is the superknower; the individual soul knows only his particular body. In the Vedic literature, it is stated as follows:k\u1e63etr\u0101\u1e47i hi \u015bar\u012br\u0101\u1e47ib\u012bja\u1e41 c\u0101pi \u015bubh\u0101\u015bubhet\u0101ni vetti sa yog\u0101tm\u0101tata\u1e25 k\u1e63etra-j\u00f1a ucyateThis body is called the k\u1e63etra, and within it dwells the owner of the body and the Supreme Lord, who knows both the body and the owner of the body. Therefore He is called the knower of all fields. The distinction between the field of activities, the knower of activities, and the supreme knower of activities is described as follows. Perfect knowledge of the constitution of the body, the constitution of the individual soul, and the constitution of the Supersoul is known in terms of Vedic literature as j\u00f1\u0101na. That is the opinion of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. To understand both the soul and the Supersoul as one yet distinct is knowledge. One who does not understand the field of activity and the knower of activity is not in perfect knowledge. One has to understand the position of prak\u1e5bti (nature), puru\u1e63a (the enjoyer of nature) and \u012b\u015bvara (the knower who dominates or controls nature and the individual soul). One should not confuse the three in their different capacities. One should not confuse the painter, the painting and the easel. This material world, which is the field of activities, is nature, and the enjoyer of nature is the living entity, and above them both is the supreme controller, the Personality of Godhead. It is stated in the Vedic language (in the \u015avet\u0101\u015bvatara Upani\u1e63ad 1.12), bhokt\u0101 bhogya\u1e41 prerit\u0101ra\u1e41 ca matv\u0101/ sarva\u1e41 prokta\u1e41 tri-vidha\u1e41 brahmam etat. There are three Brahman conceptions: prak\u1e5bti is Brahman as the field of activities, and the j\u012bva (individual soul) is also Brahman and is trying to control material nature, and the controller of both of them is also Brahman, but He is the factual controller.In this chapter it will also be explained that out of the two knowers, one is fallible and the other is infallible. One is superior and the other is subordinate. One who understands the two knowers of the field to be one and the same contradicts the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who states here very clearly, \u201cI am also the knower of the field of activity.\u201d One who misunderstands a rope to be a serpent is not in knowledge. There are different kinds of bodies, and there are different owners of the bodies. Because each individual soul has his individual capacity for lording it over material nature, there are different bodies. But the Supreme also is present in them as the controller. The word ca is significant, for it indicates the total number of bodies. That is the opinion of \u015ar\u012bla Baladeva Vidy\u0101bh\u016b\u1e63a\u1e47a. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supersoul present in each and every body apart from the individual soul. And K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a explicitly says here that real knowledge is to know that the Supersoul is the controller of both the field of activities and the finite enjoyer."}
