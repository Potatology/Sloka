The supreme abode of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, known as Goloka V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, is full of palaces made of touchstone. There are also trees, called \u201cdesire trees,\u201d that supply any type of eatable upon demand, and there are cows, known as surabhi cows, which supply a limitless supply of milk. In this abode, the Lord is served by hundreds of thousands of goddesses of fortune (Lak\u1e63m\u012bs), and He is called Govinda, the primal Lord and the cause of all causes. The Lord is accustomed to blow His flute (ve\u1e47u\u1e41 kva\u1e47antam). His transcendental form is the most attractive in all the worlds \u2013 His eyes are like lotus petals, and the color of His body is like the color of clouds. He is so attractive that His beauty excels that of thousands of Cupids. He wears saffron cloth, a garland around His neck and a peacock feather in His hair. In the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a gives only a small hint of His personal abode, Goloka V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, which is the supermost planet in the spiritual kingdom. A vivid description is given in the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101. Vedic literatures (Ka\u1e6dha Upani\u1e63ad 1.3.11) state that there is nothing superior to the abode of the Supreme Godhead, and that that abode is the ultimate destination (puru\u1e63\u0101n na para\u1e41 ki\u00f1cit s\u0101 k\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dh\u0101 param\u0101 gati\u1e25). When one attains to it, he never returns to the material world. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s supreme abode and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself are nondifferent, being of the same quality. On this earth, V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, ninety miles southeast of Delhi, is a replica of that supreme Goloka V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana located in the spiritual sky. When K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a descended on this earth, He sported on that particular tract of land known as V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, comprising about 168 square miles in the district of Mathur\u0101, India."}
