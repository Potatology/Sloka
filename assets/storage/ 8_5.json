Of this there is no doubt.And whoever, at the end of his life, quits his body remembering Me alone at once attains My nature. Of this there is no doubt.PurportIn this verse the importance of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is stressed. Anyone who quits his body in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is at once transferred to the transcendental nature of the Supreme Lord. The Supreme Lord is the purest of the pure. Therefore anyone who is constantly K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious is also the purest of the pure. The word smaran (\u201cremembering\u201d) is important. Remembrance of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is not possible for the impure soul who has not practiced K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness in devotional service. Therefore one should practice K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness from the very beginning of life. If one wants to achieve success at the end of his life, the process of remembering K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is essential. Therefore one should constantly, incessantly chant the mah\u0101-mantra \u2013 Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare. Lord Caitanya has advised that one be as tolerant as a tree (taror api sahi\u1e63\u1e47un\u0101). There may be so many impediments for a person who is chanting Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Nonetheless, tolerating all these impediments, one should continue to chant Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare, so that at the end of one\u2019s life one can have the full benefit of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness."}
