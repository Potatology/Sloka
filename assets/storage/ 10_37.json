Of the sages I am Vy\u0101sa, and among great thinkers I am U\u015ban\u0101.Of the descendants of V\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47i I am V\u0101sudeva, and of the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas I am Arjuna. Of the sages I am Vy\u0101sa, and among great thinkers I am U\u015ban\u0101.PurportK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the original Supreme Personality of Godhead, and Baladeva is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s immediate expansion. Both Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and Baladeva appeared as sons of Vasudeva, so both of Them may be called V\u0101sudeva. From another point of view, because K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a never leaves V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, all the forms of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a that appear elsewhere are His expansions. V\u0101sudeva is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s immediate expansion, so V\u0101sudeva is not different from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. It is to be understood that the V\u0101sudeva referred to in this verse of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is Baladeva, or Balar\u0101ma, because He is the original source of all incarnations and thus He is the sole source of V\u0101sudeva. The immediate expansions of the Lord are called sv\u0101\u1e41\u015ba (personal expansions), and there are also expansions called vibhinn\u0101\u1e41\u015ba (separated expansions).Amongst the sons of P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0du, Arjuna is famous as Dhana\u00f1jaya. He is the best of men and therefore represents K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Among the munis, or learned men conversant in Vedic knowledge, Vy\u0101sa is the greatest because he explained Vedic knowledge in many different ways for the understanding of the common mass of people in this Age of Kali. And Vy\u0101sa is also known as an incarnation of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a; therefore Vy\u0101sa also represents K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Kavis are those who are capable of thinking thoroughly on any subject matter. Among the kavis, U\u015ban\u0101, \u015aukr\u0101c\u0101rya, was the spiritual master of the demons; he was an extremely intelligent and far-seeing politician. Thus \u015aukr\u0101c\u0101rya is another representative of the opulence of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a."}
