Even a small beginning of such activity finds no impediment, nor can that small beginning be lost at any stage. Any work begun on the material plane has to be completed, otherwise the whole attempt becomes a failure. But any work begun in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness has a permanent effect, even though not finished. The performer of such work is therefore not at a loss even if his work in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is incomplete. One percent done in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness bears permanent results, so that the next beginning is from the point of two percent, whereas in material activity without a hundred percent success there is no profit. Aj\u0101mila performed his duty in some percentage of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, but the result he enjoyed at the end was a hundred percent, by the grace of the Lord. There is a nice verse in this connection in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (1.5.17):tyaktv\u0101 sva-dharma\u1e41 cara\u1e47\u0101mbuja\u1e41 harerbhajann apakvo \u2019tha patet tato yadiyatra kva v\u0101bhadram abh\u016bd amu\u1e63ya ki\u1e41ko v\u0101rtha \u0101pto \u2019bhajat\u0101\u1e41 sva-dharmata\u1e25\u201cIf someone gives up his occupational duties and works in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and then falls down on account of not completing his work, what loss is there on his part? And what can one gain if one performs his material activities perfectly?\u201d Or, as the Christians say, \u201cWhat profiteth a man if he gain the whole world yet suffer the loss of his eternal soul?\u201dMaterial activities and their results end with the body. But work in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness carries a person again to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, even after the loss of the body. At least one is sure to have a chance in the next life of being born again as a human being, either in the family of a great cultured br\u0101hma\u1e47a or in a rich aristocratic family that will give one a further chance for elevation. That is the unique quality of work done in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness."}
