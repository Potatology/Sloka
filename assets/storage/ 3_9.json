Therefore, O son of Kunt\u012b, perform your prescribed duties for His satisfaction, and in that way you will always remain free from bondage.Work done as a sacrifice for Vi\u1e63\u1e47u has to be performed; otherwise work causes bondage in this material world. Therefore, O son of Kunt\u012b, perform your prescribed duties for His satisfaction, and in that way you will always remain free from bondage.PurportSince one has to work even for the simple maintenance of the body, the prescribed duties for a particular social position and quality are so made that that purpose can be fulfilled. Yaj\u00f1a means Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, or sacrificial performances. All sacrificial performances also are meant for the satisfaction of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. The Vedas enjoin: yaj\u00f1o vai vi\u1e63\u1e47u\u1e25. In other words, the same purpose is served whether one performs prescribed yaj\u00f1as or directly serves Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is therefore performance of yaj\u00f1a as it is prescribed in this verse. The var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama institution also aims at satisfying Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. Var\u1e47\u0101\u015bram\u0101c\u0101ravat\u0101 puru\u1e63e\u1e47a para\u1e25 pum\u0101n/ vi\u1e63\u1e47ur \u0101r\u0101dhyate (Vi\u1e63\u1e47u Pur\u0101\u1e47a 3.8.8).Therefore one has to work for the satisfaction of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. Any other work done in this material world will be a cause of bondage, for both good and evil work have their reactions, and any reaction binds the performer. Therefore, one has to work in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness to satisfy K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a (or Vi\u1e63\u1e47u); and while performing such activities one is in a liberated stage. This is the great art of doing work, and in the beginning this process requires very expert guidance. One should therefore act very diligently, under the expert guidance of a devotee of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, or under the direct instruction of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself (under whom Arjuna had the opportunity to work). Nothing should be performed for sense gratification, but everything should be done for the satisfaction of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. This practice will not only save one from the reaction of work, but also gradually elevate one to transcendental loving service of the Lord, which alone can raise one to the kingdom of God."}
