They should be performed as a matter of duty, O son of P\u1e5bth\u0101. That is My final opinion.PurportAlthough all sacrifices are purifying, one should not expect any result by such performances. In other words, all sacrifices which are meant for material advancement in life should be given up, but sacrifices that purify one\u2019s existence and elevate one to the spiritual plane should not be stopped. Everything that leads to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness must be encouraged. In the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam also it is said that any activity which leads to devotional service to the Lord should be accepted. That is the highest criterion of religion. A devotee of the Lord should accept any kind of work, sacrifice or charity which will help him in the discharge of devotional service to the Lord."}
