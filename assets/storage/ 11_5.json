As the material nature is manifested and not manifested, similarly this universal form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is manifested and nonmanifested. It is not eternally situated in the spiritual sky like K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s other forms. As far as a devotee is concerned, he is not eager to see the universal form, but because Arjuna wanted to see K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in this way, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a reveals this form. This universal form is not possible to be seen by any ordinary man. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a must give one the power to see it."}
