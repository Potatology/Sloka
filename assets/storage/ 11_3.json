I want to see that form of Yours.PurportThe Lord said that because He entered into the material universe by His personal representation, the cosmic manifestation has been made possible and is going on. Now as far as Arjuna is concerned, he is inspired by the statements of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, but in order to convince others in the future who may think that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is an ordinary person, Arjuna desires to see Him actually in His universal form, to see how He is acting from within the universe, although He is apart from it. Arjuna\u2019s addressing the Lord as puru\u1e63ottama is also significant. Since the Lord is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, He is present within Arjuna himself; therefore He knows the desire of Arjuna, and He can understand that Arjuna has no special desire to see Him in His universal form, for Arjuna is completely satisfied to see Him in His personal form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. But the Lord can understand also that Arjuna wants to see the universal form to convince others. Arjuna did not have any personal desire for confirmation. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a also understands that Arjuna wants to see the universal form to set a criterion, for in the future there would be so many imposters who would pose themselves as incarnations of God. The people, therefore, should be careful; one who claims to be K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a should be prepared to show his universal form to confirm his claim to the people."}
