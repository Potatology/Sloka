When a person factually understands K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and his relationship with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, he naturally becomes completely indifferent to the rituals of fruitive activities, even though an experienced br\u0101hma\u1e47a. \u015ar\u012b M\u0101dhavendra Pur\u012b, a great devotee and \u0101c\u0101rya in the line of the devotees, says:sandhy\u0101-vandana bhadram astu bhavato bho\u1e25 sn\u0101na tubhya\u1e41 namobho dev\u0101\u1e25 pitara\u015b ca tarpa\u1e47a-vidhau n\u0101ha\u1e41 k\u1e63ama\u1e25 k\u1e63amyat\u0101myatra kv\u0101pi ni\u1e63adya y\u0101dava-kulotta\u1e41sasya ka\u1e41sa-dvi\u1e63a\u1e25sm\u0101ra\u1e41 sm\u0101ram agha\u1e41 har\u0101mi tad ala\u1e41 manye kim anyena me\u201cO my prayers three times a day, all glory to you. O bathing, I offer my obeisances unto you. O demigods! O forefathers! Please excuse me for my inability to offer you my respects. Now wherever I sit, I can remember the great descendant of the Yadu dynasty [K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a], the enemy of Ka\u1e41sa, and thereby I can free myself from all sinful bondage. I think this is sufficient for me.\u201dThe Vedic rites and rituals are imperative for neophytes: comprehending all kinds of prayer three times a day, taking a bath early in the morning, offering respects to the forefathers, etc. But when one is fully in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and is engaged in His transcendental loving service, one becomes indifferent to all these regulative principles because he has already attained perfection. If one can reach the platform of understanding by service to the Supreme Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, he has no longer to execute different types of penances and sacrifices as recommended in revealed scriptures. And, similarly, if one has not understood that the purpose of the Vedas is to reach K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and simply engages in the rituals, etc., then he is uselessly wasting time in such engagements. Persons in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness transcend the limit of \u015babda-brahma, or the range of the Vedas and Upani\u1e63ads."}
