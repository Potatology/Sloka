But, ceasing such engagements by experiencing a higher taste, he is fixed in consciousness.PurportUnless one is transcendentally situated, it is not possible to cease from sense enjoyment. The process of restriction from sense enjoyment by rules and regulations is something like restricting a diseased person from certain types of eatables. The patient, however, neither likes such restrictions nor loses his taste for eatables. Similarly, sense restriction by some spiritual process like a\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101\u1e45ga-yoga, in the matter of yama, niyama, \u0101sana, pr\u0101\u1e47\u0101y\u0101ma, praty\u0101h\u0101ra, dh\u0101ra\u1e47\u0101, dhy\u0101na, etc., is recommended for less intelligent persons who have no better knowledge. But one who has tasted the beauty of the Supreme Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, in the course of his advancement in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, no longer has a taste for dead, material things. Therefore, restrictions are there for the less intelligent neophytes in the spiritual advancement of life, but such restrictions are only good until one actually has a taste for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. When one is actually K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious, he automatically loses his taste for pale things."}
