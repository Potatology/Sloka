The material world is a sum total manifestation of the three modes of material nature, technically called the pradh\u0101na. The Vedic hymns sarva\u1e41 hy etad brahma (M\u0101\u1e47\u1e0d\u016bkya Upani\u1e63ad 2), tasm\u0101d etad brahma n\u0101ma r\u016bpam anna\u1e41 ca j\u0101yate (Mu\u1e47\u1e0daka Upani\u1e63ad 1.1.9), and, in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (14.3), mama yonir mahad brahma indicate that everything in the material world is a manifestation of Brahman; and although the effects are differently manifested, they are nondifferent from the cause. In the \u012a\u015bopani\u1e63ad it is said that everything is related to the Supreme Brahman, or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and thus everything belongs to Him only. One who knows perfectly well that everything belongs to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, that He is the proprietor of everything and that, therefore, everything is engaged in the service of the Lord, naturally has nothing to do with the results of his activities, whether virtuous or sinful. Even one\u2019s material body, being a gift of the Lord for carrying out a particular type of action, can be engaged in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. It is then beyond contamination by sinful reactions, exactly as the lotus leaf, though remaining in the water, is not wet. The Lord also says in the G\u012bt\u0101 (3.30), mayi sarv\u0101\u1e47i karm\u0101\u1e47i sannyasya: \u201cResign all works unto Me [K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a].\u201d The conclusion is that a person without K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness acts according to the concept of the material body and senses, but a person in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness acts according to the knowledge that the body is the property of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and should therefore be engaged in the service of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a."}
