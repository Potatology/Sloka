I am the creation and the annihilation, the basis of everything, the resting place and the eternal seed.I am the goal, the sustainer, the master, the witness, the abode, the refuge and the most dear friend. I am the creation and the annihilation, the basis of everything, the resting place and the eternal seed.PurportGati means the destination where we want to go. But the ultimate goal is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, although people do not know it. One who does not know K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is misled, and his so-called progressive march is either partial or hallucinatory. There are many who make as their destination different demigods, and by rigid performance of the strict respective methods they reach different planets known as Candraloka, S\u016bryaloka, Indraloka, Maharloka, etc. But all such lokas, or planets, being creations of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, are simultaneously K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and not K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Such planets, being manifestations of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s energy, are also K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, but actually they serve only as a step forward for realization of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. To approach the different energies of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is to approach K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a indirectly. One should directly approach K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, for that will save time and energy. For example, if there is a possibility of going to the top of a building by the help of an elevator, why should one go by the staircase, step by step? Everything is resting on K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s energy; therefore without K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s shelter nothing can exist. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the supreme ruler because everything belongs to Him and everything exists on His energy. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, being situated in everyone\u2019s heart, is the supreme witness. The residences, countries or planets on which we live are also K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the ultimate goal of shelter, and therefore one should take shelter of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a either for protection or for annihilation of his distress. And whenever we have to take protection, we should know that our protection must be a living force. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the supreme living entity. And since K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the source of our generation, or the supreme father, no one can be a better friend than K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, nor can anyone be a better well-wisher. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the original source of creation and the ultimate rest after annihilation. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is therefore the eternal cause of all causes."}
