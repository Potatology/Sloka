O son of Kunt\u012b, such pleasures have a beginning and an end, and so the wise man does not delight in them.PurportMaterial sense pleasures are due to the contact of the material senses, which are all temporary because the body itself is temporary. A liberated soul is not interested in anything which is temporary. Knowing well the joys of transcendental pleasures, how can a liberated soul agree to enjoy false pleasure? In the Padma Pur\u0101\u1e47a it is said:ramante yogino \u2019nantesaty\u0101nande cid-\u0101tmaniiti r\u0101ma-paden\u0101saupara\u1e41 brahm\u0101bhidh\u012byate\u201cThe mystics derive unlimited transcendental pleasures from the Absolute Truth, and therefore the Supreme Absolute Truth, the Personality of Godhead, is also known as R\u0101ma.\u201dIn the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam also (5.5.1) it is said:n\u0101ya\u1e41 deho deha-bh\u0101j\u0101\u1e41 n\u1e5b-lokeka\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101n k\u0101m\u0101n arhate vi\u1e0d-bhuj\u0101\u1e41 yetapo divya\u1e41 putrak\u0101 yena sattva\u1e41\u015buddhyed yasm\u0101d brahma-saukhya\u1e41 tv anantam\u201cMy dear sons, there is no reason to labor very hard for sense pleasure while in this human form of life; such pleasures are available to the stool-eaters [hogs]. Rather, you should undergo penances in this life by which your existence will be purified, and as a result you will be able to enjoy unlimited transcendental bliss.\u201dTherefore, those who are true yog\u012bs or learned transcendentalists are not attracted by sense pleasures, which are the causes of continuous material existence. The more one is addicted to material pleasures, the more he is entrapped by material miseries."}
