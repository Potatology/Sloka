And unless one is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious it is not at all possible to control the senses. As cited above, the great sage Durv\u0101s\u0101 Muni picked a quarrel with Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Ambar\u012b\u1e63a, and Durv\u0101s\u0101 Muni unnecessarily became angry out of pride and therefore could not check his senses. On the other hand, the king, although not as powerful a yog\u012b as the sage, but a devotee of the Lord, silently tolerated all the sage\u2019s injustices and thereby emerged victorious. The king was able to control his senses because of the following qualifications, as mentioned in the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (9.4.18\u201320):sa vai mana\u1e25 k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-pad\u0101ravindayorvac\u0101\u1e41si vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha-gu\u1e47\u0101nuvar\u1e47anekarau harer mandira-m\u0101rjan\u0101di\u1e63u\u015bruti\u1e41 cak\u0101r\u0101cyuta-sat-kathodayemukunda-li\u1e45g\u0101laya-dar\u015bane d\u1e5b\u015bautad-bh\u1e5btya-g\u0101tra-spar\u015be \u2019\u1e45ga-sa\u1e45gamamghr\u0101\u1e47a\u1e41 ca tat-p\u0101da-saroja-saurabhe\u015br\u012bmat-tulasy\u0101 rasan\u0101\u1e41 tad-arpitep\u0101dau hare\u1e25 k\u1e63etra-pad\u0101nusarpa\u1e47e\u015biro h\u1e5b\u1e63\u012bke\u015ba-pad\u0101bhivandanek\u0101ma\u1e41 ca d\u0101sye na tu k\u0101ma-k\u0101myay\u0101yathottama-\u015bloka-jan\u0101\u015bray\u0101 rati\u1e25\u201cKing Ambar\u012b\u1e63a fixed his mind on the lotus feet of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, engaged his words in describing the abode of the Lord, his hands in cleansing the temple of the Lord, his ears in hearing the pastimes of the Lord, his eyes in seeing the form of the Lord, his body in touching the body of the devotee, his nostrils in smelling the flavor of the flowers offered to the lotus feet of the Lord, his tongue in tasting the tulas\u012b leaves offered to Him, his legs in traveling to the holy place where His temple is situated, his head in offering obeisances unto the Lord, and his desires in fulfilling the desires of the Lord\u00a0\u2026\u00a0and all these qualifications made him fit to become a mat-para devotee of the Lord.\u201dThe word mat-para is most significant in this connection. How one can become mat-para is described in the life of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Ambar\u012b\u1e63a. \u015ar\u012bla Baladeva Vidy\u0101bh\u016b\u1e63a\u1e47a, a great scholar and \u0101c\u0101rya in the line of the mat-para, remarks, mad-bhakti-prabh\u0101vena sarvendriya-vijaya-p\u016brvik\u0101 sv\u0101tma-d\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6di\u1e25 su-labheti bh\u0101va\u1e25. \u201cThe senses can be completely controlled only by the strength of devotional service to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\u201d Also, the example of fire is sometimes given: \u201cAs a blazing fire burns everything within a room, Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, situated in the heart of the yog\u012b, burns up all kinds of impurities.\u201d The Yoga-s\u016btra also prescribes meditation on Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, and not meditation on the void. The so-called yog\u012bs who meditate on something other than the Vi\u1e63\u1e47u form simply waste their time in a vain search after some phantasmagoria. We have to be K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious \u2013 devoted to the Personality of Godhead. This is the aim of the real yoga."}
