How does he speak, and what is his language? How does he sit, and how does he walk?PurportAs there are symptoms for each and every man, in terms of his particular situation, similarly one who is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious has his particular nature \u2013 talking, walking, thinking, feeling, etc. As a rich man has his symptoms by which he is known as a rich man, as a diseased man has his symptoms by which he is known as diseased, or as a learned man has his symptoms, so a man in transcendental consciousness of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a has specific symptoms in various dealings. One can know his specific symptoms from the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. Most important is how the man in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness speaks; for speech is the most important quality of any man. It is said that a fool is undiscovered as long as he does not speak, and certainly a well-dressed fool cannot be identified unless he speaks, but as soon as he speaks, he reveals himself at once. The immediate symptom of a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious man is that he speaks only of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and of matters relating to Him. Other symptoms then automatically follow, as stated below."}
