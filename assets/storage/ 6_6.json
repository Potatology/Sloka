Unless the mind is controlled, the practice of yoga (for show) is simply a waste of time. One who cannot control his mind lives always with the greatest enemy, and thus his life and its mission are spoiled. The constitutional position of the living entity is to carry out the order of the superior. As long as one\u2019s mind remains an unconquered enemy, one has to serve the dictations of lust, anger, avarice, illusion, etc. But when the mind is conquered, one voluntarily agrees to abide by the dictation of the Personality of Godhead, who is situated within the heart of everyone as Param\u0101tm\u0101. Real yoga practice entails meeting the Param\u0101tm\u0101 within the heart and then following His dictation. For one who takes to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness directly, perfect surrender to the dictation of the Lord follows automatically."}
