Therefore, this verse is considered to be the essence of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. The Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is a book directed to the conditioned souls, who are engaged in the material world with the purpose of lording it over nature and who do not know of the real, spiritual life. The Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is meant to show how one can understand his spiritual existence and his eternal relationship with the supreme spiritual personality and to teach one how to go back home, back to Godhead. Now here is the verse which clearly explains the process by which one can attain success in his spiritual activity: devotional service.As far as work is concerned, one should transfer his energy entirely to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious activities. As stated in the Bhakti-ras\u0101m\u1e5bta-sindhu (1.2.255),an\u0101saktasya vi\u1e63ay\u0101nyath\u0101rham upayu\u00f1jata\u1e25nirbandha\u1e25 k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-sambandheyukta\u1e41 vair\u0101gyam ucyateNo work should be done by any man except in relationship to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. This is called k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-karma. One may be engaged in various activities, but one should not be attached to the result of his work; the result should be done only for Him. For example, one may be engaged in business, but to transform that activity into K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, one has to do business for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. If K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the proprietor of the business, then K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a should enjoy the profit of the business. If a businessman is in possession of thousands and thousands of dollars, and if he has to offer all this to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, he can do it. This is work for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Instead of constructing a big building for his sense gratification, he can construct a nice temple for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and he can install the Deity of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and arrange for the Deity\u2019s service, as is outlined in the authorized books of devotional service. This is all k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-karma. One should not be attached to the result of his work, but the result should be offered to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and one should accept as pras\u0101dam the remnants of offerings to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. If one constructs a very big building for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and installs the Deity of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, one is not prohibited from living there, but it is understood that the proprietor of the building is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. That is called K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. If, however, one is not able to construct a temple for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, one can engage himself in cleansing the temple of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a; that is also k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-karma. One can cultivate a garden. Anyone who has land \u2013 in India, at least, any poor man has a certain amount of land \u2013 can utilize that for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a by growing flowers to offer Him. One can sow tulas\u012b plants, because tulas\u012b leaves are very important and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a has recommended this in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. Patra\u1e41 pu\u1e63pa\u1e41 phala\u1e41 toyam. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a desires that one offer Him either a leaf, or a flower, or fruit, or a little water \u2013 and by such an offering He is satisfied. This leaf especially refers to the tulas\u012b. So one can sow tulas\u012b and pour water on the plant. Thus, even the poorest man can engage in the service of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. These are some of the examples of how one can engage in working for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.The word mat-parama\u1e25 refers to one who considers the association of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in His supreme abode to be the highest perfection of life. Such a person does not wish to be elevated to the higher planets such as the moon or sun or heavenly planets, or even the highest planet of this universe, Brahmaloka. He has no attraction for that. He is only attracted to being transferred to the spiritual sky. And even in the spiritual sky he is not satisfied with merging into the glowing brahma-jyotir effulgence, for he wants to enter the highest spiritual planet, namely K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47aloka, Goloka V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana. He has full knowledge of that planet, and therefore he is not interested in any other. As indicated by the word mad-bhakta\u1e25, he fully engages in devotional service, specifically in the nine processes of devotional engagement: hearing, chanting, remembering, worshiping, serving the lotus feet of the Lord, offering prayers, carrying out the orders of the Lord, making friends with Him, and surrendering everything to Him. One can engage in all nine devotional processes, or eight, or seven, or at least in one, and that will surely make one perfect.The term sa\u1e45ga-varjita\u1e25 is very significant. One should disassociate himself from persons who are against K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Not only are the atheistic persons against K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, but so also are those who are attracted to fruitive activities and mental speculation. Therefore the pure form of devotional service is described in Bhakti-ras\u0101m\u1e5bta-sindhu (1.1.11) as follows:any\u0101bhil\u0101\u1e63it\u0101-\u015b\u016bnya\u1e41j\u00f1\u0101na-karm\u0101dy-an\u0101v\u1e5btam\u0101nuk\u016blyena k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47\u0101nu-\u015b\u012blana\u1e41 bhaktir uttam\u0101In this verse \u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b clearly states that if anyone wants to execute unalloyed devotional service, he must be freed from all kinds of material contamination. He must be freed from the association of persons who are addicted to fruitive activities and mental speculation. When, freed from such unwanted association and from the contamination of material desires, one favorably cultivates knowledge of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, that is called pure devotional service. \u0100nuk\u016blyasya sa\u1e45kalpa\u1e25 pr\u0101tik\u016blyasya varjanam (Hari-bhakti-vil\u0101sa 11.676). One should think of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and act for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a favorably, not unfavorably. Ka\u1e41sa was an enemy of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s. From the very beginning of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s birth, Ka\u1e41sa planned in so many ways to kill Him, and because he was always unsuccessful, he was always thinking of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Thus while working, while eating and while sleeping, he was always K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious in every respect, but that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness was not favorable, and therefore in spite of his always thinking of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a twenty-four hours a day, he was considered a demon, and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a at last killed him. Of course anyone who is killed by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a attains salvation immediately, but that is not the aim of the pure devotee. The pure devotee does not even want salvation. He does not want to be transferred even to the highest planet, Goloka V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana. His only objective is to serve K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a wherever he may be.A devotee of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is friendly to everyone. Therefore it is said here that he has no enemy (nirvaira\u1e25). How is this? A devotee situated in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness knows that only devotional service to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a can relieve a person from all the problems of life. He has personal experience of this, and therefore he wants to introduce this system, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, into human society. There are many examples in history of devotees of the Lord who risked their lives for the spreading of God consciousness. The favorite example is Lord Jesus Christ. He was crucified by the nondevotees, but he sacrificed his life for spreading God consciousness. Of course, it would be superficial to understand that he was killed. Similarly, in India also there are many examples, such as \u1e6ch\u0101kura Harid\u0101sa and Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja. Why such risk? Because they wanted to spread K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, and it is difficult. A K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person knows that if a man is suffering it is due to his forgetfulness of his eternal relationship with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Therefore, the highest benefit one can render to human society is relieving one\u2019s neighbor from all material problems. In such a way, a pure devotee is engaged in the service of the Lord. Now, we can imagine how merciful K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is to those engaged in His service, risking everything for Him. Therefore it is certain that such persons must reach the supreme planet after leaving the body.In summary, the universal form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, which is a temporary manifestation, and the form of time which devours everything, and even the form of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, four-handed, have all been exhibited by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Thus K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the origin of all these manifestations. It is not that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is a manifestation of the original vi\u015bva-r\u016bpa, or Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the origin of all forms. There are hundreds and thousands of Vi\u1e63\u1e47us, but for a devotee no form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is important but the original form, two-handed \u015ay\u0101masundara. In the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 it is stated that those who are attached to the \u015ay\u0101masundara form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in love and devotion can see Him always within the heart and cannot see anything else. One should understand, therefore, that the purport of this Eleventh Chapter is that the form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is essential and supreme.Thus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Eleventh Chapter of the \u015ar\u012bmad Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 in the matter of the Universal Form."}
